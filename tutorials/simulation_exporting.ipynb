    "# Exporting in models\n",
    "This tutorial provides inspiration and potentially useful code for exporting data in a `pp.Model` based simulation for visualization in e.g. [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/). While the PorePy [model class](./incompressible_flow_model.ipynb) and the [exporter](./exporter.ipynb) are introduced elsewhere, this tutorial provides some detail on how to combine them. To this end, we will choose the transient model for mixed-dimensional poroelasticity with fracture deformation and adjust it to make sure the solution is exported according to our requirements, i.e. at the right stages of the simulation and that we export the right fields/variables. The tutorial consists of two parts. The first covers standard usage and the second covers more advanced usage related to debugging. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a very simple case, indicating which methods could be overwritten to specify which variables are exported. In addition to overwriting the \\_export method, we introduce a separate method defining the data to be exported when write_vtu is called. We rely on `pp.ContactMechanicsBiot` calling `self._export()` in `after_newton_convergence` and `self.exporter.write_pvd()` in `after_simulation`, which yields an export at each time step and a pvd file giving ParaView access to all time steps."

The \"time step\" suffix of an iteration file is the sum of the iteration index and the product of the current time step index and $r$, which is the smallest power of ten exceeding the maximum number of non-linear iterations. \n",
