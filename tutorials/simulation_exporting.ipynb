    "# Exporting in models - DEPRECATED\n",
    "*This tutorial is deprecated. It will be updated during an ongoing overhaul of tutorials.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides inspiration and potentially useful code for exporting data in a `pp.Model` based simulation for visualization in e.g. [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/). While the PorePy [model class](./incompressible_flow_model.ipynb) and the [exporter](./exporter.ipynb) are introduced elsewhere, this tutorial provides some detail on how to combine them. To this end, we will choose the transient model for mixed-dimensional poroelasticity with fracture deformation and adjust it to make sure the solution is exported according to our requirements, i.e. at the right stages of the simulation and that we export the right fields/variables. The tutorial consists of two parts. The first covers standard usage and the second covers more advanced usage related to debugging. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a very simple case, indicating which methods could be overwritten to specify which variables are exported. In addition to overwriting the \\_export method, we introduce a separate method defining the data to be exported when write_vtu is called. We rely on `pp.ContactMechanicsBiot` calling `self._export()` in `after_newton_convergence` and `self.exporter.write_pvd()` in `after_simulation`, which yields an export at each time step and a pvd file giving ParaView access to all time steps."

    "Suppose we want to perform a simulation similar to above, but require more data for visualization. For instance, we might very reasonably want to look at the displacement jump on the fracture. This is not a primary variable, and thus not immediately available in the `pp.STATE` subdictionary of the fracture subdomain dictionary. We implement this as a second mixin class which we combine with `MDPoroelasticity`, facilitating modular reuse of the tailored exporting class in combination with e.g. pp."

    "We now turn to exporting data for each iteration when solving the nonlinear system. This second part is significantly more advanced than the preceeding part and some users may want to skip it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exporting iterations can be quite handy when debugging or trying to make sense of why your model doesn't converge. Moreover, even when everything works as a dream, you might want to visualize how convergence is reached, for instance to distinguish between global and local effects. \n",
    "\n",
    "We stress that not only which variables to export but also when you wish to export them may vary between applications. In the model provided below, we export at all iterations using a separate exporter, keeping track of time step and iteration number using the vtu file suffix and collecting them using a single pvd file. The \"time step\" suffix of an iteration file is the sum of the iteration index and the product of the current time step index and $r$, which is the smallest power of ten exceeding the maximum number of non-linear iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Expecting that the simulation may crash or be stopped at any point during, we (over)write a pvd file each time a new vtu file is added. Alternative approaches and refinements include writing one pvd file for each time step and writing debugging files on some condition, e.g. that the iteration index exceeds some threshold."
