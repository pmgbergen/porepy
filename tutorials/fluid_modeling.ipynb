    "Fluids can be defined in terms of two contexts: components and phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the number of components is something the modeler chooses naturally, the number (and more importantly type) of phases is\n",
    "an unknown number in the general thermodynamic sense.\n",
    "In PorePy, the modeler must define the (maximal) number and types of phases expected in the course of simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling can then be roughly performed in 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defining the components in the fluid (water, CO2, ...)\n",
    "2. Defining the expected phases (1 gas phase, 2 liquid phases for example)\n",
    "3. Introducing a thermodynamic model for fluid properties (densities, enthalpies, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note on distinction between fluid, phase and component properties:**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> It makes no sense to talk about the density of a component, say water.\n",
    "> Liquid and gaseous water have greatly different densities.\n",
    "> I.e., extensive properties like density and enthalpy are always related to the phase.\n",
    "> Multiple components can be present in a phase and influence the properties.\n",
    "> Extensive properties of fluid mixtures (consisting of multiple components in multiple phases), depend in a clearly defined manner on the respective properties of present phases (usually a weighted sum of phase properties).\n",
    "\n",
    "The default fluid in PorePy models consists of 1 component, and 1 phase containing that component.\n",
    "In this simple case, the fluid properties are equal to the (single) phase properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class [FluidMixin](../src/porepy/compositional/compositional_mixins.py#L1042) provides respective functionalities for creating a fluid, and is part of all models in PorePy.\n",
