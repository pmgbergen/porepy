    "Fluids can be defined in terms of two contexts: components and phases.\n",

    "\n",
    "While the number of components is something the modeler chooses naturally, the number (and more importantly type) of phases is\n",
    "an unknown number in the general thermodynamic sense.\n",
    "In PorePy, the modeler must define the (maximal) number and types of phases expected in the course of simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling can then be roughly performed in 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defining the components in the fluid\n",
    "2. Defining the expected phases (1 gas phase, 2 liquid phases for example)\n",
    "3. Introducing a thermodynamic model for fluid properties (densities, viscosities, enthalpies, ...).\n",

    "> **Note on distinction between fluid, phase and component properties:**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> It makes no sense to talk about the density of a component, say water.\n",
    "> Liquid and gaseous water have greatly different densities.\n",
    "> I.e., extensive properties like density and enthalpy are always related to the phase.\n",
    "> Multiple components can be present in a phase and influence the phase properties.\n",
    "> Overall properties of fluid mixtures (consisting of multiple components in multiple phases), depend in a clearly defined manner on the respective properties of present phases (usually a weighted sum of phase properties).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> PorePy does not focus on a complete description of thermodynamic fluid properties, but only\n",
    "> on those terms, which appear in flow and transport equations (conservation of mass and energy).\n",
    "> I.e., they are important since they contribute to the non-linearity of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default fluid in PorePy models consists of 1 component, and 1 phase containing that component.\n",
    "In this simple case, the fluid properties are equal to the (single) phase properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class [FluidMixin](../src/porepy/compositional/compositional_mixins.py#L1042) provides methods for creating and configuring the `fluid` attribute of PorePy models,\n",

    "## Final remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to set up a model with multiple components and\\or multiple phases.\n",
    "- How to write constitutive laws for thermodynamic properties, if multiple phases are involved.\n",
    "- How to externalize computations of thermodynamic properties using the `EquationOfState` class.\n",
    "- How to define what the input for the external computations is.\n",
    "- How to model fluids using both, mixed in constitutive laws and externalized computations, with special emphasis on the order of mixins in the hybrid approach.\n",
    "- How to deal with the increasing complexity in terms of DOFs, and what is required to close the system (including IC and BC values).\n",
    "- Where to find mixins for transport equations, especially those handling the automatized update of phase properties using external calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We emphasize again, that when modelling complex fluids and their properties, a familiarity with the introduced variables is required, and where they appear in the PDEs (f.e. do I need BC values for the new variables?).\n",
    "Thorough knowledge about the mixin framework is also required for advanced usage of PorePy's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common pitfalls:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unawareness of the variables introduced by setting different components in different phases.\n",
    "- Improper definition of `dependencies_of_phase_properties` when using some derived classes of `EquationOfstate`.\n",
    "- Faulty/ missing implementations of derivatives of phase properties when using external calculations, often result in an unintended Quasi-Newton approach with an inexact Jacobian.\n",
    "- Using the EoS approach, and not being aware that the model must be informed on how to deal with thermodynamic properties, which are **not** part of the externalized computations (use some mixins to avoid creating redundant `SurrogateFactory`s).\n",
    "- Forgetting BC values for the fractional variables, which require now a dynamic way of thinking about respective methods (see `def s_bc` and `def x_bc`)\n",
    "- Transport problem: Depending on how strong the non-linearity is introduced by an EoS, a proper tuning of the time stepping algorithm is required, depending on domain size, refinement and permeability. Blindly using `pp.run_timedependen_model` will likely result in failure.\n",
