    "is represented by a mixed-dimensional geometry. Quantities are projected between the\n",
    "fracture (lower dimensional subdomain, colored in black) and the rock (higher\n",
    "dimensional subdomain, colored in light grey) through an interface (right diagram,\n",
    "dashed blue).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one grid/subdomain on each side of the interface, and in addition to being\n",
    "referred to as subdomains, they are also termed primary and secondary grid. Typically,\n",
    "the primary grid is of one dimension higher than the interface, while the secondary grid\n",
    "is of the same dimension as the interface.\n",

    "We now want to project an arbitrary quantity $\\gamma$ from the higher dimensional\n",
    "subdomain (primary grid, $\\Omega_h$) to the lower dimensional subdomain (secondary grid,\n",
    "$\\Omega_l$). The projection is done via the interface $\\Gamma_j$, and it therefore\n",
    "requires projecting in two-steps: first from the primary grid to the interface, and then\n",
    "from the interface to the secondary grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the process is described as follows: $$ \\Omega_h\\overset{\\Pi_{j}^h\n",
    "\\gamma}{\\longrightarrow} \\Gamma_j\\overset{{\\Xi}_{l}^j (\\beta)}{\\longrightarrow}\n",
