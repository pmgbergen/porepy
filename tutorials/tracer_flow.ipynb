    "## Mathematical model\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the required steps and classes, let's first recount the mathematical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single phase flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This model aspect is covered in full detail in the respective [tutorial](./single_phase_flow.ipynb).\n",
    "We recall here that the physics of single phase flow introduce one variable, pressure $p$,\n",
    "and one governing equation, the (total) fluid mass balance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\Phi \\rho\\right) - \\nabla\\cdot\\left( \\dfrac{\\rho}{\\mu} \\mathbf{K} \\nabla p\\right) = 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transport equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Porepy utilizes the overall fraction formulation for multi-component fluids.\n",
    "The mass corresponding to a component $i$ is represented by an overall fraction $z_i$.\n",
    "One component can arbitrarily be chosen as the reference component and its overall fraction $z_r$\n",
    "is computed by unity of fractions\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z_r = 1 - \\sum_{i\\neq r} z_i,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "i.e. it is a dependent variable. For the sake of our model, we set water as the reference component\n",
    "and the only remaining quantity of interest is the tracer fraction $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass in one phase is in general also split between the present components, leading to\n",
    "the requirement to introduce partial fractions of a component $i$ in some phase $j$.\n",
    "But since we assume single-phase flow, the fraction of mass of one component in the single phase\n",
    "is due to conservation of mass equal to its overall fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to write the tracer transport equation for the unknown $z$ in the following compact form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\Phi \\rho z\\right) - \\nabla\\cdot\\left( \\dfrac{\\rho z}{\\mu} \\mathbf{K} \\nabla p\\right) = 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simplified setting with only 1 phase and 2 components, the variables of interest are\n",
    "\n",
    "- pressure $p$ and\n",
    "- independent overall fraction $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The governing equations are given by\n",
    "\n",
    "- total mass balance (pressure equation) and\n",
    "- one component mass balance (tracer transport equation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The extension of this model to the mixed-dimensional setting is a technicality, which can be omitted here.\n",
    "In short, the mass flux between subdomains (*interface darcy flux*) is seen as the flux of overall mass.\n",
    "The mass flux of one component is modelled analogously to the balance equation:\n",
    "The (total) interface darcy flux is scaled down with the fraction $z$.\n",
    "The choice of $z$ on the interface is handled via Upwind-coupling."
