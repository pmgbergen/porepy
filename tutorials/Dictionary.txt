Data fields (in grid buckets):
    Nodes:
        apertures
        bc              -
        bc_val          - For Neumann faces, the value is interpreted as a discharge and positive values correspond to influxes
        bound_flux      - discretization for back-calculation of boundary fluxes for primal formulations, i.e., bound_flux*bound_val yields the fluxes at the boundary faces. See flux.
        
        
        flux - discretization for back-calculation of fluxes for primal formulations, i.e., flux*p yields the fluxes at the internal faces.
        
        
        perm
        source - source (positive) or sink (negative) terms. One discharge value ([m^dim/s]) for each cell. Remember to account for cell volume, also aperture^dim. 
    Edges:
        coupling_flux - discretization for back-calculation of fluxes between subdomains for primal formulations. By convention, the fluxes computed are as seen from the higher-dimensional subdomain, and may be computed as coupling_flux*np.concatenate(p_higher, p_lower). See flux.
        perm_n - permeability normal to the lower-dimensional subdomain.
