    "# Exporting in models\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides inspiration and potentially useful code for exporting data in a `pp.Model` based simulation for visualization in e.g. [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/). While the PorePy [model class](./single_phase_flow.ipynb) and the [exporter](./exporter.ipynb) are introduced elsewhere, this tutorial provides some detail on how to combine them. To this end, we will choose the transient model for mixed-dimensional poroelasticity with fracture deformation and adjust it to make sure the solution is exported according to our requirements, i.e. at the right stages of the simulation and that we export the right fields/variables. The tutorial consists of two parts. The first covers standard usage and the second covers more advanced usage related to debugging. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a very simple case, indicating which methods could be overwritten to specify which variables are exported. The starting point is the `DataSavingMixin` class, which is responsible for all things related to saving and exporting of data during a simulation. By default, it exports all primary variables as well as apertures and specific volumes, see `data_to_export`. Exporting is performed at the start of the simulation and at the end of each time step."

    "# Iteration exporting for debugging\n",
    "We now turn to exporting data for each iteration when solving the nonlinear system. This second part is significantly more advanced than the preceeding part and some users may want to skip it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We stress that not only which variables to export but also when you wish to export them may vary between applications. In the model provided below, we export at all iterations using a separate exporter, keeping track of time step and iteration number using the vtu file suffix and collecting them using a single pvd file. The \"time step\" suffix of an iteration file is the sum of the iteration index and the product of the current time step index and $r$. Here $r$ is the smallest power of ten exceeding the maximum number of non-linear iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Expecting that the simulation may crash or be stopped at any point, we (over)write a pvd file each time a new vtu file is added. Alternative approaches and refinements include writing one pvd file for each time step and writing debugging files on some condition, e.g. that the iteration index exceeds some threshold."
