    "# Compositional flow simulation\n",
    "In this tutorial, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting a compositional flow simulation in porepy. A compositional model is designed to simulate the transport of multiple components within a multi-phase flow system. First, we will present the compositional flow equations for two-phase system-namingly, liquid (L) and vapour (V) comprising salt (NaCl) and water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) components. We will assume negligible capillary pressure, gravity segregation, chemcical reactions between components, and energy dispersion respectively. Subsequently, we will introduce further assumptions to simplify the model to represent a linear tracer-like setting, with which we will investigate its solution setup in porepy using basically the formulation in `GeothermalFlowModel`class.\n",

    "For simplicity, we will assume constant global pressure and temperature with respect to time in the system. Consequently, the pressure and energy equations become negligible in the above model. This assumption leads to the presence of a single liquid (L) phase, eliminating the need to account for multiphase interactions. We will omit the correlation calculations used to determine other phase-behavior thermodynamic properties. In this case, we primarily consider a mass transport equation of a single passive tracer (the NaCl component) in a water medium."
