    "The combination of highly nonlinear multiphysics problems and the non-smooth formulation of contact mechanics may lead to severe convergence issues.\n",
    "To improve convergence, we provide a line search algorithm tailored to the irregularities of the contact equations, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01184.\n",

    "We define a dummy problem with one fracture and trivial problem data (boundary conditions etc.). \n",
    "This allows us to emphasize the steps needed to invoke the line search algorithm.\n",
    "For more challenging problems which would not converge with regular Newton, please confer the examples of the above manuscript."
