    "Flash, or more general phase separation calculations is the process of determining the equilibrium state of a system under conditions specified by thermodynamic state functions.\n",
    "At equilibrium the available mass splits into one or multiple physical states like liquid or gas.\n",
    "To specify the thermodynamic state, three state quantities are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "- mass of present components/ chemical species (mole numbers, overall compositions, ...)\n",
    "- state function related to work energy (pressure or volume)\n",
    "- state function related to thermal energy (temperature, internal energy, enthalpy)\n",
    "\n",
    "PorePy provides some functionality to determine the equilibrium state of fluid mixtures.\n",
    "It does **not** cover the full range of possible thermodynamic calculations and state definitions.\n",
    "Instead it focuses on the properties and state definitions relevant for thermal compositional flow in the subsurface as indicated above.\n",
    "One core ability of PorePy's flash framework is the ability to solve large amounts of flash calculations very efficiently,\n",
    "making it suitable for cell-wise applications in flow simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains the flash API and presents example calculations using a compiled persistent-variable flash.\n",
    "A familiarity with the [tutorial on fluid modeling](./fluid_modeling.ipynb) is of advantage."

    "What you need to know as a user is that \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The framework relies on just-in-time compilation.\n",
    "2. Compilation can be disabled for debugging or smaller problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flash framework has certain levels of abstractions which require some ahead-of-time compilation.\n",
    "While this is not yet fully supported by numba, we achieve a similar effect with static signature typing, which forces compilation ahead of usage.<br>\n",
    "*This leads to a certain overhead in execution time when importing the flash module for the first time, and when compiling the flash for a specific fluid.*<br>\n",
    "It also requires an explicit compilation step before the flash calculations are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "To disable compilation and just use the pure Python implementation, do the following:"

    "While the structure of the equations is always the same, individual terms depend on the present components, their physical parameters and the underlying equation of state.\n",
