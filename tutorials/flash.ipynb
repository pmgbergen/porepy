    "# Flash calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Flash, or more general phase separation calculations is the process of determining the equilibrium state of a system under conditions specified by thermodynamic state functions.\n",
    "At equilibrium the available mass splits into one or multiple physical states like liquid or gas.\n",
    "To specify the thermodynamic state, three state quantities are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "- mass of present components/ chemical species (mole numbers, overall compositions, ...)\n",
    "- state function related to work energy (pressure or volume)\n",
    "- state function related to thermal energy (temperature, internal energy, enthalpy)\n",
    "\n",
    "PorePy provides some functionality to determine the equilibrium state of fluid mixtures.\n",
    "It does **not** cover the full range of possible thermodynamic calculations and state definitions.\n",
    "Instead it focuses on the properties and state definitions relevant for thermal compositional flow in the subsurface as indicated above.\n",
    "One core ability of PorePy's flash framework is the ability to solve large amounts of flash calculations very efficiently,\n",
    "making it suitable for cell-wise applications in flow simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains the flash API and presents example calculations using a compiled persistent-variable flash.\n",
    "A familiarity with the [tutorial on fluid modeling](./fluid_modeling.ipynb) and on [cubic equations of state](./cubic_eos.ipynb) is of advantage."

    "What you need to know as a user is that \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The framework relies on *eager* just-in-time compilation.\n",
    "2. Compilation can be disabled for debugging or smaller problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flash framework has certain levels of abstractions which would require some ahead-of-time compilation.\n",
    "While this is not yet fully supported by numba, we achieve a similar effect with static signature typing, which forces compilation ahead of usage (eager JIT).<br>\n",
    "*This leads to a certain overhead in execution time when importing the flash module for the first time, and when compiling the flash for a specific fluid.*<br>\n",
    "It also requires an explicit compilation step before the flash calculations are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "To disable compilation and just use the pure Python implementation, do the following:"

    "All entries in `params` are optional, i.e., they have default values. We demonstrate some of the possibilities here and explain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `'solver'` defines which solver to use. The current default is a Non-Parametric Interior Point Method, which is also the only solver currently availabe. You can find it [here](../src/porepy/compositional/flash/solvers/npipm_solver.py).\n",
    "2. `'solver_params'` can be provided to override the default solver parametrization, in case some fine tuning is necessary. There are [general solver parameters](../src/porepy/compositional/flash/solvers/_core.py#40) and solver-specific parameters (for [npipm see here](../src/porepy/compositional/flash/solvers/npipm_solver.py#38)). Note that the NPIPM consists of several methods, including a line search. I.e., respective parameters are included. Parameters belonging to a specific method are usually indicated with `<methodname>_` as a prefix.\n",
    "3. The `'mode'` defines how the flash problems are solved, sequentially or in parallel. Since we solve only 1 problem, we use the sequential solver (which is the default case). This framework parallelizes over the available CPU cores.\n",
    "4. `'gen_arg_params'` and `'phase_property_params'` are essentially the same but passed at different times of the procedure. `'gen_arg_params'` is used in the solver, supporting convergence, while `'phase_property_params'` is used for the final evaluation of fluid properties after the solver exits. For how the `gen_arg_params` are used, see next section on generic flash argument. For how the `phase_property_params` are used, see the [general property computations](../src/porepy/compositional/compiled_eos.py#1008) of the EoS class."
