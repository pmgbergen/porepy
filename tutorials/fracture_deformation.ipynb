    "# Fracture deformation modeling\n",

    "- general modeling of fracture deformation and single model components\n",

    "# General modeling \n",
    "Fracture deformation constraints the relative displacements of matrix blocks across a fracture. In the simplest case, it decomposes into normal and tangential directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant variables are relative displacements $u$ (displacement jumps) and tractions $t$ across the fracture. The normal and tangential components are denoted by $n$ and $t$, respectively. The normal component is defined as the projection of the relative displacement onto the normal vector of the fracture. The tangential component is defined as the relative displacement minus the normal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "The non-penetration condition encodes that the relative displacement in the normal direction is non-negative.\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "-t_n \\leq  0 \\qquad \\wedge \\qquad [u]_n \\geq g_n \\qquad \\wedge \\qquad t_n ([u]_n - g_n) = 0\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The frictional sliding condition encodes that the tangential traction is bounded by a friction bound. If it is stricly less than the friction bound, the contact is in stick state (the tangential relative velocity is zero). If it is equal to the friction bound, the contact is in slip state (the tangential relative velocity is non-zero and aligns with the tangential traction).\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "\\|t_t\\| \\leq b_p \\qquad \\wedge \\qquad \\|t_t\\| < b_p \\Rightarrow [\\dot{u}]_t = 0 \\qquad \\wedge \\qquad \\|t_t\\| = b_p \\Rightarrow \\exists \\xi>0: t_t = \\xi [\\dot{u}]_t\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "While these two conditions serve as general framework for modeling contact, single components can be further detailed. In particular, displacement jumps, gaps and the friction bound allow for further modeling, added to your PorePy model by adding the right mixins. These are discussed separately below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no additional mixins are added, the above physical model is invoked. The associated material parameters of interest and to be used in the model setup are as follows:"
