"""THIS SCRIPT IS CURRENTLY NOT IN USE, BUT IS KEPT FOR LEGACY REASONS

This script is used to modify a Conda environment.yml file
so that it is compatible with installing the environment inside the
Docker container with a PorePy installation.

For the moment, the script does the following modifications to the
specified environment file:
  1) The name of the environment is changed to pp_env (this is
     necessary for the Docker image to work)
  2) If no Python version is provided, it set to 3.10.

Example: To enforce Python 3.9 (instead of the default 3.10),
modify the environment.yml file (found in 
${POREPY_DIR}/dockerfiles/environment.yml) to read

name: pp_env
dependencies:
   python: 3.9
