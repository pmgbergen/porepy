    # Install the dependencies, which is needed to make mypy happy. Unravelling of the
    # second command: The expression in the angular brackets is a python command that
    # fetches the dependencies section in pyproject.toml; this is then made available to
    # pip via -r. Option --no-bulid-isolation makes pip not use an isolated environment
    # for the install (hence the installed packages are sure to be available also after
    # the build), while --no-deps will only install the specified packages (in this
    # case, the dependencies of PorePy). The third line similarly installs the
    # development dependencies.
