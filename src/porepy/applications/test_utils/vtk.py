    """Determine whether the contents of two vtu files are identical.

    Helper method to determine whether two vtu files, accessed by their paths, are
    identical. Returns True if both files are identified as the same, False otherwise.
    This is the main auxiliary routine used to compare down below whether the Exporter
    produces identical outputs as stored reference files.

    .. note:
        It is implicitly assumed that Gmsh returns the same grid as for the reference
        grid; thus, if this test fails, it should be rerun with an older version of
        Gmsh to test for failure due to external reasons.

    Parameters:
        test_file: Name of the test file.
        reference_file: Name of the reference file
        overwrite: Whether to overwrite the reference file with the test file. This
            should only ever be done if you are changing the "truth" of the test.

    Returns:
        Boolean. True iff files are identical.
