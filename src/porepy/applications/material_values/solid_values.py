"""This file contains values for solid parameters.

The values provided here should be taken as representative, and not be mistaken to be
from one specific location or be of one specific rock sample. It was very difficult to
find one reference providing all the material values we needed, and therefore there are
several references per material.

For now we provide parameter values for the following solids:
* Granite
* Basalt

The dictionaries containing parameter values is obtained by e.g.
pp.solid_values.granite. They can be used in a simulation by passing `solid =
pp.SolidConstants(pp.solid_values. granite)` as a material parameter on model
initiation.

Granite:
---------------

Specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and density are gathered from:
* Miranda et al. Effect of temperature on the thermal conductivity of a granite with
high heat production from Central Portugal. https://doi.org/10.1007/s41513-018-0096-9


Density, thermal expansion coefficient, porosity, shear modulus and lame lambda are
gathered from:
* Sousa, L. Petrophysical properties and durability of granites employed as
building stone: A comprehensive evaluation. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10064-013-0553-9

The values are for a kind of granite in Portugal. Shear modulus and lame lambda is
computed from the P- and S-wave speeds in the paper.


Biot coefficient is gathered from:
* Selvadurai et al. A multi-phasic approach for estimating the Biot coefficient for
Grimsel granite. https://doi.org/10.5194/se-10-2001-2019


Coefficient of friction is gathered from:
* Byerlee, J. D. Frictional characteristics of granite under high confining pressure.
https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1029/JZ072i014p03639

Figure 23: Coefficient of friction is the slope of the normal stress/tangential stress
curve.


Permeability is gathered from:
* Petrini et al. Inversion in the permeability evolution of deforming Westerly granite
near the brittle-ductile transition. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-03435-0

The authors of the article present initial permeabilitiy for various westerly granite
samples in Table 1. All are of order 1e-18 and 1e-19.


Specific storage is gathered from:
* Hsieh et al. Field Determination of the Three-Dimensional Hydraulic Conductivity
Tensor of Anisotropic Media: 2. Methodology and Application to Fractured Rocks.
https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1029/WR021i011p01667

Values are provided in 1/m. We convert to 1/Pa using chapter 4 in:
* https://books.gw-project.org/groundwater-storage-in-confined-aquifers

The average specific storage value from the paper:
S_s = 4.65e-6 m^-1 = 4.65e-6 / (rho_water * g) Pa^-1 = 4.74e-10 Pa^-1.

(Using rho_water = 1000 kg m^-3, g = 9.81 m s^-2)
