"""Module containing mixin classes for introducing local equilibrium equations into a
motel.

Local equilibrium equations are single, cell-wise algebraic equations, introducing
the thermodynamically consistent approach to modelling secondary expressions like
phase densities.
They also introduce necessarily new variables into the system (molar fractions).

Instances of :class:`UnifiedEquilibriumMixin` require an attribite ``equilibrium_type``
to be set, which must not be ``None``. This is to inform the remaining framework
that local equilibrium assumptions (instead of some constitutive laws) were introduced.
