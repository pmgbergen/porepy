"""This module contains the (abstract) base class for elements of a mixture:

- Components
- Compounds (Pure component altered by presence of solutes)
- Phase (Physical phase like liquid or gas)
- Mixture

Components are models for phase-changing chemical species inside a mixture.
They are either pure components (with relevant fractional variables) or
compounds, where other, present species act as parameters.

The hierarchy is as follows:

1. :class:`Component`:
   A phase-changing representation of a species involving some physical constants
   Additionally, this class represents a variable quantity in the equilibrium
   problem. It can appear in multiple phases and has a fraction of the overall mass
   associated with it.
2. :class:`Compound`:
   Additionally to being a variable quantity, this class has other species
   with related solute fractions functioning as parameters for thermodynamic
   properties. The solute fractions are **not** variables of the equilibrium problem.
   They might nevertheless be transportable by f.e. a coupled flow problem.
3. :class:`Phase`:
   An object representing a physical phase like gas-phase or a liquid-phase.
   A phase can contain multiple phase-changing components and the modeller must set
   those explicitly (see :attr:`Phase.components`).
   Components in a phase are characterized by their fraction of mass
   (:attr:`Phase.fraction_of`), relative to the
   fraction of mass in a phase (:attr:`Phase.fraction`).
   Components have additionally an fugacity coefficient in a phase
   (:attr:`Phase.fugacity_of`)
   In the unified setting, all phases contain every modelled component.

   The phase has also physical properties (like density and enthalpy) which come into
   play when formulating more complex equilibrium models coupled with flow & transport.
4. :class:`Mixture`:
    A basic representation of a mixture which is a collection of anticipated phases and
    present components.

    It puts phases and components into context and assignes fractional unknowns.
    The mixture expects the overall fraction of a component (:attr:`Component.fraction`)
    to never be zero. Otherwise a smaller mixture can be modelled.

    Serves as a managing instance and provides functionalities to formulate the flash
    equations using PorePy's AD framework.

Note:
    Phases are meant to be based on an Equation of State.
    A basic interface for such an equation of state is defined by :class:`AbstractEoS`.

class Compound(Component):
    """Abstract base class for compounds in a mixture.

    A compound is a simplified, but meaningfully generalized set of components inside a
    mixture, for which it makes sense to treat it as a single component.

    It is represents one species, the solvent, and contains arbitrary many solutes.

    A compound can appear in multiple phases and its thermodynamic properties are
    influenced by the presence of solutes.

    Solutes are transportable and are represented by a molar fraction relative to
    the :attr:`~Component.fraction` of the compound, i.e. the moles of a solute are
    given by a product of mixture density, compound fraction and solute fraction.

    The solvent fraction is eliminated by unity.

    Note:
        Due to the generalization, the solvent and solutes alone are not considered as
        genuine components which can transition into various phases,
        but rather as parameters in the flash problem.
        Only the compound as a whole splits into various phases. Fractions in phases
        are associated with the compound.
        Solvent and solute fractions are not variables in the flash problem.

    Example:
        Brines with species salt and water as solute and solvent, where it is
        sufficient to calculate how much brine is in vapor or liquid form,
        and the information about how the salt distributes across phases is irrelevant.
        The salt in this case is a **transportable** quantity,
        whose concentration acts as a parameter in the flash.

        Another example would be the black-oil model, where black-oil is treated as a
        compound with various hydrocarbons as pseudo-components.

class Mixture:
    """Basic mixture class managing modelled components and phases.

    This is a layer-1 implementation of a mixture, containing the core functionality
    and objects representing the variables and basic thermodynamic properties.

    The equilibrium problem is set in the unified formulation (unified flash).
    It allows one gas-like phase and an arbitrary number of liquid-like phases.

    Flash algorithms are built around the mixture management utilities of this class.

    This class implements also basic intersection points with PorePy's AD framework and
    hence the remaining modelling concepts in this package.

    Important:
        - The first, non-gas-like phase is treated as the reference phase.
          Its molar fraction and saturation will not be part of the primary variables.
        - The first component is set as reference component.
          Its mass conservation will not be part of the equilibrium equations.
        - Choice of reference phase and component influence the choice of equations and
          variables, keep that in mind. It might have numeric implications.

    Notes:
        If the user wants to model a single-component mixture, a dummy component must be
        added as the first component (reference component for elimination),
        with a feed fraction small enough s.t. its effects on the
        thermodynamic properties are negligible.

        This approximates a single-component mixture, due to the flash system being
        inherently singular in this case. Numerical issues can appear if done so!

    Parameters:
        components: A list of components to be added to the mixture.
            This are the chemical species which can appear in multiple phases.
        phases: A list of phases to be modelled.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the model assumptions are violated.

            - 1 gas phase must be modelled.
            - At least 2 components must be present.
            - At least 2 phases must be modelled.
