"""Sub-package of ``porepy.composite`` with implementations using the Peng-Robinson EoS.

The work here is largely based on below references.

This subpackage implements the standard Peng-Robinson equation of state,
including some mixing rules and model components.

It provides an intermediate abstraction for model components
:class:`~porepy.composite.peng_robinson.pr_components.Component_PR`,
such that custom implementations for some physical and chemical quantities can be done.

The core of the module is its EoS class
:class:`~porepy.composite.peng_robinson.eos.PengRobinsonEoS`,
which implements the calculation of physical properties.

It provides furthermore an interface to load binary interaction parameters from the
package ``thermo``, as well as some mixing rules to obtain a mixture's cohesion and
covolume, such as
:class:`~porepy.composite.peng_robinson.mixing.VanDerWaals`.

The mixing rules are independent of the EoS and can in theory be used for any other
cubic EoS.
