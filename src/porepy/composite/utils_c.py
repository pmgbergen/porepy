"""Module containing utility functions for numba compiled flash computations.

The utility functions depend mostly on the order of unknowns stored in the solution
vector ``X_gen``.
The convention in the compiled flash is as follows:

1. ``num_comp - 1`` values for independent feed fractions.
2. 2 values for target equilibrium state (p-T, h-p, v-h) defining the flash procedure.
3. (optional) ``num_phase - 1`` saturation values.
4. (optional) 1 pressure value if pressure is unknown.
5. (optional) 1 temperature value if temperature is unknown.
6. ``num_phase - 1`` molar phase fraction values.
7. ``num_phase * num_comp`` molar phase compositions values, starting with the reference
   phase.

    NJIT-ed function with signature
    ``(float64[:], UniTuple(int32, 2)) -> Tuple(float64[:,:], float64[:], float64[:])``.

    The feed fractions are always the first ``num_comp - 1`` entries
    (feed per component except reference component).

    The phase compositions are always the last ``num_phase * num_comp`` entries,
    orderered per phase per component (phase-major order),
    with phase and component order as given by the mixture model.

    The ``num_phase - 1`` entries before the phase compositions, are always
    the independent molar phase fractions.

    Important:
        This method also computes the feed fraction of the reference component and the
        molar fraction of the reference phase.
        Hence it returns 2 values not found in ``X_gen``.

        The computed values are always the first ones in the respective vector.

    Parameters:
        X_gen: Generic argument for a flash system.
        npnc: 2-tuple containing information about number of phases and components
            (``num_phase`` and ``num_comp``).

    Returns:
