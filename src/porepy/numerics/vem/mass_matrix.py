"""
Mass matrix classes for a discretization of a L2-mass bilinear form with constant test
and trial functions for mixed methods (e.g. RT0, MVEM).

The discretization takes into account cell volumes and the mass_weight given in
the parameters (the mass weight can again incorporate porosity, time step,
apertures etc),  so that the mass matrix (shape (sd.num_faces + sd.num_cells)^2)
has the following diagonal for the cell_dof:

    sd.cell_volumes * mass_weight

The right hand side is null.
There is also a class for the inverse of the mass matrix.

Note that the matrix equals the discretization operator in this case, and so is stored
directly in the data as
self._key() + "mixed_mass" or self._key() + "inv_mixed_mass".
The corresponding (null) rhs vectors are stored as
self._key() + "bound_mixed_mass" or self._key() + "bound_inv_mixed_mass", respectively.
