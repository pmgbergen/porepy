    Determine where a fracture should propagate based on the displacement
    solution u using the displacement correlation technique.
    Parameters:
        gb  - grid bucket. For now, contains one higher-dimensional (2D or 3D)
            grid and one lower-dimensional fracture, to be referred to as g_h
            and g_l, respectively. Note that the data corresponding to d_h
            should contain the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, both
            assumed (for now) to be constant.
        u (array): solution as computed by FracturedMpsa. One displacement
            vector for each cell center in g_h and one for each of the fracture
            faces. The ordering for a 2D g_h with four cells and four fracture
            faces (two on each side of two g_l fracture cells) is

            [u(c0), v(c0), u(c1), v(c1), u(c2), v(c2), u(c3), v(c3),
             u(f0), v(f0), u(f1), v(f1), u(f2), v(f2), u(f3), v(f3)]

            Here, f0 and f1 are the "left" faces, the original faces before
            splitting of the grid, found in g_h.frac_pairs[0]. f2 and f3 are
            the "right" faces, the faces added by the splitting, found in
            g_h.frac_pairs[1].
        critical_sifs (array): the stress intensity factors at which the
            fracture yields, one per mode (i.e., we assume this rock parameter
            to be homogeneous for now)
        kw: optional keyword arguments, to be explored. For now:
            rm (float): oprimal distance from tip faces to correlation points.
                If not provided, an educated guess is made by estimate_rm().
            use_normal_rm_distance (bool) - if True, the distance from
                correlation point to tip face is used instead of the distance
                between the correlation point and the tip face centroid. These
                may differ for 2d fractures.

        faces_h_to_open: list (one entry for each g_l) of (possibly empty)
            arrays of higher-dimensional faces to be split.
        sifs: list (one entry for each g_l) of the calculated stress intensity
