"""
For any discretization class compatible with PorePy, wrap_discretization associates
a discretization with all attributes of the class' attributes that end with
'_matrix_key'.


Example:
    # Generate grid
    >>> g = pp.CartGrid([2, 2])
    # Associate an Ad representation of an Mpfa method, aimed this grid
    >>> discr = MpfaAd(keyword='flow', grids=[g])
    # The flux discretization of Mpfa can now be accesed by
    >>> discr.flux
    # While the discretization of boundary conditions is available by
    >>> discr.bound_flux.

    The representation of different discretization objects can be combined with other
    Ad objects into an operator tree, using lazy evaluation.

    It is assumed that the actual action of discretization (creation of the
    discretization matrices) is performed before the operator tree is parsed.
