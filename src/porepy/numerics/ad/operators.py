    For combinations of variables on different subdomains, see :class:`MergedVariable`.

    Conversion of the variable into numerical value should be done with respect to the
    state of an array; see :meth:`Operator.evaluate`. Therefore, the variable does not
    implement the method :meth:`Operator.parse`.

    A variable is associated with either a grid or an interface. Therefore it is assumed
    that either ``subdomains`` or ``interfaces`` is passed as an argument.

    Parameters:
        name: Variable name.
        ndof: Number of dofs per grid element.
            Valid keys are ``cells``, ``faces`` and ``nodes``.
        subdomains (length=1): List containing a single grid.
        interfaces (length=1): List containing a single mortar grid.
        num_cells: Number of cells in the grid.
            Only relevant if this is an interface variable.
