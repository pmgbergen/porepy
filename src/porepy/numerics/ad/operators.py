    For combinations of variables on different subdomains, see
    :class:`MixedDimensionalVariable`.

    A variable is associated with either a grid or an interface. Therefore it is assumed
    that either ``subdomains`` or ``interfaces`` is passed as an argument.

    Also, a variable is associated with a specific time and iterate index. :meth:`parse`
    will return the values at respective index on its :meth:`domain`.

    Important:
        Each atomic variable (a variable on a single grid) has a :attr:`id`, unique
        among created variables. This ID is used to map the DOFs in the global system
        and hence critical.

        As of now, variable instances representing the same quantity at different
        time and iterate steps have the same ID.

        This might with future development (e.g. adaptive mesh refinement).

    Parameters:
        name: Variable name.
        ndof: Number of dofs per grid element.
            Valid keys are ``cells``, ``faces`` and ``nodes``.
