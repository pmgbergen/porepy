            operates.
        dof_manager (pp.DofManager): Degree of freedom manager used for this
            EquationManager.
        equations (List of Ad Operators): Equations assigned to this EquationManager.
            can be expanded by direct addition to the list.
        variables (Dict): Mapping from grids or grid tuples (interfaces) to Ad
            variables. These are set at initialization from the GridBucket, and should
            not be changed later.
        secondary_variables (List of Ad Variables): List of variables that are secondary,
            that is, their derivatives will not be included in the Jacobian matrix.
            Variables will be represented on atomic form, that is, merged variables are
            unravelled. Secondary variables act as a filter during assembly, that is,
            they do not impact the ordering or treatment of variables.
        row_block_indices_last_assembled (np.ndarray): Row indices for the start of blocks
            corresponding to different equations in the last assembled system. The last item
            in the array is the total number of rows, so that row indices for block i can
            be recovered by np.arange(row_bl..[i], row_bl..[i+1]). The user must relate the
            indices to equations (either in self.equations or the equation list given to the
