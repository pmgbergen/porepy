"""This module contains AD functionality for represening complex terms for which an
evaluation directly with (forward) AD would be too expensive, or the values are provided
by some external computations.

The classes contained here are essentially wrappers for values provided by the user.

The base class for representing some term which depends on independent variables is
:class:`SurrogateFactory`. The user can call it using a sequence of grids to get a
representation as an AD operator on respective domains.

Note:
    Due to how AD parsing is implemented, the :class:`SurrogateFactory` requires a
    reference to the mixed-dimensional grid to store and later access the data.

:class:`SurrogateFactory` is a factory and management class for
:class:`SurrogateOperator`. The latter is the (actual) AD-compatible representation,
on some specified grids, at a specified time and iterate index.

Note:
    A connection between operator and factory class is established via
    :attr:`SurrogateOperator.fetch_data`. Since operators are in general *not aware* of
    the mixed-dimensional grid, a connection to the factory is required to fetch the
    data for the correct grids, at the correct time and iterate index.
    Therefore, the class :class:`SurrogateOperator` should not be instantiated directly,
    but only calling the factory class.

    We also cannot overload :meth:`~porepy.numerics.ad.operators.Operator.parse`,
    because a surrogate operator has children, and no way of knowing the
    structure of the Jacobian if value and Jacobian are evaluated.

Example:

    Let's consider the set-up of a model, which needs to represent the fluid density as
    a :class:`SurrogateFactory` assuming it's computation is provided from some
    third-party package.

    The class follows the mixin approach, i.e. the variables pressure and temperature
    are provided by some other class as callables.

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyFluid:

            mdg: porepy.MixedDimensionalGrid

            pressure: Callable[
                [porepy.SubdomainsOrBoundaries], porepy.MixedDimensionalVariable
            ]

            temperature: Callable[
                [porepy.SubdomainsOrBoundaries], porepy.MixedDimensionalVariable
            ]

            def __init__(self):

                self.fluid_density: Callable[
                    [porepy.GridlikeSequence], porepy.Operator
                ] = SurrogateFactory(
                    name = 'fluid_density',
                    mdg = self.mdg,
                    dependencies = [self.pressure, self.temperature],
                    time_dependent = True,
                )

    The model will now have a callable ``fluid_density``, which returns an AD operator
    if called with some grids in the mixed-dimensional grid.

    The fluid density depends on pressure and temperature. If respective operators are
    parsed, they have two (cell-wise) derivatives with respect to the dependencies and
    the result is an AD array.

    Since the fluid density appears in the accumulation term of any balance equation,
    it is ``time_dependent`` and the user can update boundary values or progress
    values (and derivative values) in time.
    To avoid unintentional, possibly memory-heavy storage of data, the user must
    declare the expression explicitly as time-dependent. If the expression is not
    time-dependent, the update and progress methods will do nothing.
    (Except for the boundary values, since the current boundary values are stored at
    the iterate index 0.)

    Arbitrary iterate depth is supported by default.

    To get a representation of the accumulation term in all subdomains, the user has now
    the option to make the following call somewhere else in the model mixins:

    >>> rho = self.fluid_density(self.mdg.subdomains())
    >>> rho_prev = rho.previous_timestep()

    Since the fluid density may also appear as a non-linear weight in some advective
    flux, boundary values are also required

    >>> rho_bc = self.fluid_density(self.mdg.boundaries())

    Values can be updated in time in the solution strategy using

    >>> new_boundary_values: numpy.array = ...
    >>> self.fluid_density.boundary_values = new_boundary_values

    Note, that the update is performed on the instance of
    :class:`SurrogateFactory`, not on its products :class:`SurrogateOperator`.

    Iterate values at the current time step (to be solved for) can be updated in a
    similar fashion:

    >>> new_vals: numpy.array = ...
    >>> new_derivatives: numpy.array = ...
    >>> self.fluid_density.subdomain_values = new_vals
    >>> self.fluid_density.subdomain_derivatives = new_derivatives

    In the next parsing of the fluid density at the current time and iterate, an
    AD array will be returned with values equaling ``new_vals`` and a sparse CSR matrix
    with diagonal blocks containing the two derivative values for pressure and
    temperature in their respective columns.

    Note that the user must inform the :class:`SurrogateFactory` about it's number
    of dofs (similar to when creating variables in the equation system).
    This information is used to support the user and raise exceptions if various
    ``new_values`` are not of expected shape.

class SurrogateFactory:
    """A representation of some dependent quantity in the PorePy modelling and AD
    framework, meant for terms where the evaluation is done elsewhere and then stored.

    This is a factory class, callable using some domains in the md-setting to create
    AD operators representing this expression on respective domains.
    See the module-level documentation for more information on the relation between
    :class:`SurrogateFactory` and :class:`SurrogateOperator`.

    For an example of how to use it, see
    :module:`~porepy.numerics.ad.surrogate_operator`.

    **On the boundary:**

    The class creates a
    :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.opeators.TimeDependentDenseArray` using its given
    name and the boundary grids passed to the call.
    Boundary values can hence be updated like any other term in the model framework.
    But they can also be updated using :meth:`boundary_values` for convenience.

    The surrogate operator has no derivatives and no iterate values on the boundary.

    **On subdomains and interfaces:**

    The factory creates a :class:`SurrogateOperator`, which represents the data
    managed by this class on subdomains and interfaces.
    The operator has instances of
    :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.operators.MixedDimensionalVariable` as children
    (dependencies).

    The :class:`SurrogateOperator` supports the notion of previous timesteps and iterate
    values. Updates of respective values are handled by this factory class.

    **Call with empty domain list:**

    This functionality is implemented for completeness reasons, such that the factory
    can also be called on an empty list of domains. In this case the property
    returns an empty array wrapped as an Ad array.

    This functionality is implemented since general PorePy models implement equations
    in the md-setting. It makes this class compatible for models without fractures or
    interfaces.

    Notes:

        1. The ``dependencies`` are assumed to be of first order. I.e., independent
           variables. Nested dependencies are not supported.
        2. Data is stored in a grid's data dictionary. This class generates an extra
           key based on its name to store the derivative values using PorePy's AD
           utilities.
        3. This class provides management functionality to update values grid-wise and
           globally, in both iterative and time sense, as well as derivative values.
           On boundaries, it does not support derivatives and no storage of data in the
           iterative sense, only in time.

    Parameters:
        name: Assigned name of the expression. Used to name operators and to store
            values in the data dictionaries
        mdg: The mixed-dimensional grid on which the operators are defined.
        dependencies: A sequence of callables/ constructors for independent variables on
            which the expression depends. The order passed here is reflected in the
            order of stored derivative values.

            When calling the factory on some grids, it is expected that the
            dependencies are defined there.
