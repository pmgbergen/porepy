    The class implements methods for arithmetic operations with floats, numpy arrays,
    scipy sparse matrices, and other ``AdArrays``. For these operations, the following
    general rules apply:
      * Scalars can be used for any arithmetic operation. As a convenience measure to
        limit the number of cases that mest be handled and maintained, the scalar must
        be a float.
      * Numpy arrays are assumed to be 1d and have the same size as the ``AdArray``.
        Numpy arrays can be used for any operation except matrix multiplication (the @
        operator). *When adding, subtracting or multiplying a numpy array and an
        AdArray, the AdArray should be placed first, so, DO: AdArray + numpy.array,
        DO NOT: numpy.array + AdArray. The latter will give erratic behavior, see
        https://stackoverflow.com/a/6129099. Similarly, do not try to take
      * Scipy matrices can only be used for matrix-vector products (the @ operator), and
        then only for left multiplication. While right multiplication could technically
        work, depending on the size of the matrix, this is not the way the Ad framework
        is intended to be used, and so this operation is not supported.
      * Other AdArrays can be used with all arithmetic operations except the @
        operator.

    A violation of these rules will result in a ``ValueError``.
