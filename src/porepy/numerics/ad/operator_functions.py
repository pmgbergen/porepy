### BASE CLASSES ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


class AbstractFunction(Operator):
    """Abstract class for all operator functions, i.e. functions evaluated on some other AD
    operators.

    Implements the callable-functionality and provides abstract methods for obtaining function
    values and the Jacobian.
    The abstraction intends to provide means for approximating operators, where values are
    e.g. interpolated and the Jacobian is approximated using FD.

    Note:
        One can flag the operator as ``ad_compatible``. If flagged, the AD framework passes
        AD arrays directly to the callable ``func`` and will **not** call the abstract methods
        for values and the Jacobian during operator parsing.
        If for some reason one wants to flag the function as AD compatible, but still have the
        abstract methods called, this is as of now **not** supported.

        For now only one child class, porepy.ad.Function, flags itself always as AD compatible.

    Parameters:
        func: callable Python object representing a (numeric) function.
            Expected to take numerical information in some form and return numerical
            information in the same form.
        name: name of this instance as an AD operator
        array_compatible (optional): If true, the callable ``func`` will be called
            using arrays (numpy.typing.ArrayLike). Flagging this true, the user ensures
            that the callable can work with arrays and return respectively
            formatted output. If false, the function will be evaluated element-wise
            (scalar input). Defaults to False.
        ad_compatible (Optional): If true, the callable ``func`` will be called using
            the porepy.ad.AdArray.

            Note that as of now, this will effectively bypass the abstract methods
            for generating values and the Jacobian, assuming both will be provided
            correctly by the return value of ``func``.

            Defaults to False.
