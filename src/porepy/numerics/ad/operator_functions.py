### BASE CLASSES -----------------------------------------------------------------------


class AbstractFunction(Operator):
    """Abstract class for all operator functions, i.e. functions evaluated on some other AD
    operators.

    Implements the callable-functionality and provides abstract methods for obtaining function
    values and the Jacobian.
    The abstraction intends to provide means for approximating operators, where values are
    e.g. interpolated and the Jacobian is approximated using FD.

    Note:
        One can flag the operator as ``ad_compatible``. If flagged, the AD framework passes
        AD arrays directly to the callable ``func`` and will **not** call the abstract methods
        for values and the Jacobian during operator parsing.
        If for some reason one wants to flag the function as AD compatible, but still have the
        abstract methods called, this is as of now **not** supported.

        For now only one child class, porepy.ad.Function, flags itself always as AD compatible.

    Parameters:
        func: callable Python object representing a (numeric) function.
            Expected to take numerical information in some form and return numerical
            information in the same form.
        name: name of this instance as an AD operator
        array_compatible (optional): If true, the callable ``func`` will be called
            using arrays (numpy.typing.ArrayLike). Flagging this true, the user ensures
            that the callable can work with arrays and return respectively
            formatted output. If false, the function will be evaluated element-wise
            (scalar input). Defaults to False.
        ad_compatible (Optional): If true, the callable ``func`` will be called using
            the porepy.ad.AdArray.

            Note that as of now, this will effectively bypass the abstract methods
            for generating values and the Jacobian, assuming both will be provided
            correctly by the return value of ``func``.

            Defaults to False.

NumericType = Union[pp.number, np.ndarray, AdArray]


def admethod(
    func: Optional[Callable] = None,
    ad_ftype: Type[AbstractFunction] = Function,
    ad_fkwargs: dict = {},
) -> Callable[[Callable], ADMethod] | ADMethod:
    """Decorator to be used for class methods and functions to turn them into
    AD operator functions if they receive AD operators as input arguments.

    Note:
        This function serves as a factory for :class:`ADMethod` instances, which
        will replace the decorated function.

        The process between decorations with ``@admethod`` and ``@admethod(...)`` are
        slightly different. See examples below and documentation of :class:`ADMethod`.

    Examples:

        .. rubric:: Example 1

        Here we demonstrate how to use this function, with and without a call during
        decoration.

        Without a call, the default arguments are used to create a
        :class:`Function` factory using :class:`ADMethod`.

        .. code:: python

            import porepy as pp

            @admethod
            def dummy_rel_perm(saturation):
                return saturation * saturation

        During execution time,
        above example code will call ``admethod`` with the function ``dummy_rel_perm``
        passed as argument ``func``.
        ``dummy_rel_perm`` will then be replaced with an instance of :class:`ADMethod`,
        which creates :class:`Function`
        instances and calls them everytime the argument ``saturation`` is
        an AD operator.
        So calling ``dummy_rel_perm`` with e.g.,
        a :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.operators.Variable` will return another AD
        operator, equivalent to the syntax.

        >>> pp.ad.Function(dummy_rel_perm, name='')(saturation)

        If ``saturation`` is not an AD operator, but any other numerical format
        accepted by :class:`ADMethod`, then ``dummy_rel_perm`` is callable like usual
        and will immediatly return the value ``saturation * saturation``.

        .. rubric:: Example 2

        For using other operator functions besides :class:`Function`, you can use
        this function with a call during decoration:

        .. code:: python

            @admethod(
                ad_ftype=pp.ad.DiagonalJacobianFunction, ad_fkwargs={'multipliers'=[2]}
            )
            def dummy_rel_perm(saturation):
                return saturation * saturation

        This will give the same result as in above example, only that calls with
        AD operators will not perform a call to :class:`Function`, but to
        :class:`DiagonalJacobianFunction`.
        ``ad_fkwargs`` will be used as arguments in the instantiation of
        :class:`DiagonalJacobianFunction`.

        Warning:
            When decorating with a call to ``admethod``, the arguments
            ``ad_ftype`` and ``ad_fkwargs`` must be given as keyword arguments.

        .. rubric:: Example 3

        Consider a decorated function taking two arguments

        .. code:: python

            @admethod
            def mutiply(x, y):
                return x * y

        As seen above, here the multiplication will be wrapped into an
        :class:`Function`.

        We can compute cheap partial derivatives w.r.t. ``y``, if we let ``y`` be an
        :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.forward_mode.AdArray` and ``x`` some other
        numeric format.
        ``y`` can either be a simple ``AdArray`` with ``val=...`` and
        ``jac=numpy.array([0, 1])``,
        or a :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.operators.Variable`,
        which wrapps above construction.

        >>> x = 3
        >>> y = pp.ad.Variable(...)
        >>> dy = multiply(x, y).evaluate(...)

        ``dy`` will in effectively be an expression multiplying the constant value of
        ``x`` with the ``AdArray`` representing ``y``, hence a partial derivative.

        .. rubric:: Example 4

        As of now, this decorator is compatible with Python's
        :obj:`classmethod`, :obj:`staticmethod` and :obj:`~abc.abstractmethod`.

        In combination with other decorators, make sure to use ``admethod`` as the
        outermost/topmost decorator.

        .. code:: python

            import abc

    Note:
        **When to use this.**

        When dealing with complex heuristic laws implemented as functions,
        this decorator enables the user to evaluate the function as usual if
        the input args are not AD operators.

        But if one wants to use the AD framework, it is often very bad for performance
        reasons to implement the heuristic law directly with AD operators, due to
        the possibly large operator tree and expensive recursion in the evaluation.

        This function aims for feeding the heuristic law directly with instances of
        :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.forward.AdArray`, using the framework provided
        by AD operator functions. It reduces the heuristic law to a single evaluation
        process in the final operator tree.

        Another obvious benefit is, that this approach does not produce any overhead if
        the decorated function is called without AD arguments, but nevertheless
        enabling the user to use both worlds in a flexible way.

    Parameters:
        func: ``default=None``

            Reference to the decorated function.
        ad_ftype: ``default=:class:`Function``

            A type of AD operator function
            (see :class:`AbstractFunction`) which should replace the decorated function
            if it is called with AD Operators as arguments.
        ad_fkwargs: ``default={}``

            A dictionary containing keyword arguments for the
            instantiation of the AD operator function of type ``ad_ftype``.

    Returns:
        An instance of :class:`ADMethod` mimicing the decorated function and capable
        of taking AD operators  and\or other numeric formats as arguments.

class ADMethod:
    """(Decorator) Class for methods/functions taking numerical values and
    returning numerical values, e.g. physical properties or heuristic laws.

    The decorated function is expected to take

    - real numbers ,
    - :obj:`~numpy.ndarray` or
    - :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.forward_mode.AdArray`,

    and return one of above.

    Note:
        In this context, instances of :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.forward_mode.AdArray`
        are treated as *numerical* values, whereas instances of
        :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.operator.Operator` are treated as AD operators.

    Important:
        As of now, the framework for AD Operator functions treats only arguments,
        not keyword arguments.

        Therefore, this decorator is restricted to functions which take only positional
        arguments.

    The decorated function will be able to take
    :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.operator.Operator`-instances as arguments and return
    another operator if done so.

    As soon as a single function argument is recognized to be an AD operator,
    a call to the decorated function will return an operator which needs to be
    evaluated using :meth:`~porepy.numerics.ad.operator.Operator.evaluate`.

    Otherwise the call will instantly pass the arguments to respective function and
    return its respective return values, if successful.

    In the case of AD operators as arguments,
    the return value will be an AD operator of the type passed to the decorator.

    Note:
        For full flexibility in the decoration, the user should resort to using
        the factory :func:`admethod` (see examples therein).

        The argument ``func`` is not optional, due to the creation of instances of this
        class being outsourced to :func:`admethod` for clarity reasons.

        For more information about how references to decorated functions are handled in
        Python, check Python's official docs.

    Parameters:
        func: Decorated function object.
        ad_ftype: Type reference to an AD operator function to be instantiated
            during a call with AD operator arguments.
        ad_fkwargs: Keyword arguments to be passed when instantiating an operator
            of type ``ad_function_type``.
