This module contains a routine for iteration-based time-stepping control.

The algorithm is heavily inspired by [1], which was later used in [2].

    simulating the one-dimensional movement of water, heat, and multiple solutes in
    variably-saturated media. University of California-Riverside Research Reports, 3, 1-240.

    Finite-Volume-Based Module for Unsaturated Poroelasticity. Advanced Modeling with the
    MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox.

Algorithm Overview:

    Provided `recompute_solution = False`, the algorithm will adapt the time step
    based on `iterations`. If `iterations` is less than the lower endpoint of the
    optimal iteration range, then it will increase the time step by a factor
    `iter_relax_factors[1]`. If `iterations` is greater than the upper endpoint of the
    optimal iteration range it will decrease the time step by a factor
    `iter_relax_factors[0]`. Otherwise, `iterations` lies in the optimal iteration
    range, and time step remains unchanged.

    If `recompute_solution = True`, then the time step will be reduced by a factor
    `recomp_factor` with the hope of achieving convergence in the next time level. The
    algorithm will keep decreasing the time step unless: (1) the time step is equal to the
    minimum admissible time step or (2) the number of recomputing attempts has been
    exhausted. In both cases, an error will be raised.

    Now that the algorithm has determined a new time step, it has to ensure three more
    conditions, (1) the calculated time step cannot be smaller than dt_min,
    (2) the calculated time step cannot be larger than dt_max, and (3) the
    time step cannot be too large such that the next time will exceed a scheduled
    time. These three conditions are implemented in this order of precedence and
    will override any of the previous calculated time steps.

Algorithm Workflow in Pseudocode:

        iterations // number of non-linear iterations

    IF time > final simulation time THEN
        RETURN None
    ENDIF

    IF constant_dt is True THEN
        RETURN dt_init
    ENDIF

    IF recompute_solution is False THEN
        RESET counter that keeps track of number of recomputing attempts
        IF iterations < lower endpoint of optimal iteration range THEN
            DECREASE dt // multiply by an over relaxation factor > 1
        IFELSE iterations > upper endpoint of optimal iteration range THEN
            INCREASE dt // multiply by an under relaxation factor < 1
        ELSE
            PASS // dt remains unchanged
        ENDIF
    ELSE
        IF number of recomputing attempts has not been exhausted THEN
            IF dt is equal to dt_min THEN
                RAISE Error // since recomputation will not have any effect
            ENDIF
            SUBTRACT dt from current time // we have to "go back in time"
            DECREASE dt // multiply by recomputation factor < 1
            INCREASE counter that keeps track of number of recomputing attempts
        ELSE
            RAISE Error // maximum number of recomputing attempts has been exhausted
        ENDIF

class TimeManager:
    """Parent class for iteration-based time-stepping control routine.

    Parameters:
        schedule: Array-like object containing the target times for the simulation.
            Unless a constant time step is prescribed, the time-stepping algorithm will adapt
            the time step so that the scheduled times are guaranteed to be hit.

            The `schedule` must contain minimally two elements, corresponding to the
            initial and final simulation times. Schedules of size > 2 must contain strictly
            increasing times. Examples of VALID inputs are: [0, 1], np.array([0, 10, 30, 50]),
            and [0, 1*pp.HOUR, 3*pp.HOUR]. Examples of INVALID inputs are: [1], [1, 0],
            and np.array([0, 1, 1, 2]).

            If a constant time step is used (`constant_dt = True`), then the time step
            (`dt_init`) is required to be compatible with the scheduled times in `schedule`.
            Otherwise, an error will be raised. Examples of VALID inputs for `constant_dt =
            True` and `dt_init = 2` are: [0, 2] and np.array([0, 4, 6, 10]). Examples of
            INVALID inputs for `constant_dt = True` and `dt_init = 2` are [0, 3] and
            np.array([0, 4, 5, 10]).
        dt_init: Initial time step. The initial time step is required to be positive and
            less or equal than the final simulation time.
        constant_dt: Whether to treat the time step as constant or not.
            If True, then the time-stepping control algorithm is effectively bypassed. The
            algorithm will NOT adapt the time step in any situation, even if the user
            attempts to recompute the solution. Nevertheless, the attributes such as
            scheduled times will still be accessible, provided `dt_init` and `schedule` are
            compatible.
        dt_min_max: Minimum and maximum permissible time steps.
            If None, then the minimum time step is set to 0.1% of the final simulation time
            and the maximum time step is set to 10% of the final simulation time. If given,
            then the first and second elements of the tuple corresponds to the minimum and
            maximum time steps, respectively.

            To avoid oscillations and ensure a stable time step adaptation in combination with
            the relaxation factors, we further require:
                dt_min_max[0] * iter_relax_factors[1] < dt_min_max[1], and
                dt_min_max[1] * iter_relax_factors[0] > dt_min_max[0].
            Note that in practical applications, these conditions are usually met.
        iter_max: Maximum number of iterations.
        iter_optimal_range: Optimal iteration range.
            The first and second elements of the tuple correspond to the lower and upper
            endpoints of the optimal iteration range.
        iter_relax_factors: Relaxation factors.
            The first and second elements of the tuple corresponds to the under-relaxation and
            over-relaxation factors, respectively. We require the under-relaxation factor
            to be strictly lower than one, whereas the over-relaxation factor is required to
            be strictly greater than one. Note that the values of `iter_relax_factors` must be
            selected such that they avoid oscillations in combination with `dt_min_max`. Refer
            to the documentation of `dt_min_max` for the explicit condition to be satisfied.
        recomp_factor: Failed-to-converge solution recomputation factor.
            Factor by which the time step will be multiplied in case the solution must be
            recomputed. We require `recomp_factor` to be strictly less than one.
        recomp_max: Failed-to-converge maximum recomputation attempts. The maximum allowable
            number of consecutive recomputation attempts.
        print_info. Whether to print on-the-fly time-stepping information or not.

    Example:
        # The following is an example on how to initialize a time-stepping object
        time_manager = pp.TimeManager(
            schedule=[0, 10],
