        Parameters:
            schedule (List): List containing the target times for the simulation.
                The time-stepping algorithm will adapt the time step so that the target
                times are guaranteed to be hit/reached. The list must contain minimally
                two elements, corresponding to the the initial and final simulation times.
                Lists of length > 2 must contain strictly increasing times.
                Examples of valid inputs are:
                  [0, 1], [0, 10, 30, 50], [0, 1*pp.HOUR, 3*pp.HOUR].
                Examples of invalid inputs are:
                  [1], [1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 2].
            dt_init (float): Initial time step.
            dt_min_max (Tuple of float): Minimum and maximum permissible time steps.
            iter_max (int): Maximum number of iterations. Default is 15.
            iter_optimal_range (Tuple of int): Lower and upper optimal iteration range.
                Default is (4, 7).
            iter_lowupp_factor (Tuple of float, optional): Lower and upper multiplication
                factors. Default is (1.3, 0.7).
            recomp_factor (float). Failed-to-converge recomputation factor.
                Default is 0.5.
            recomp_max (int). Failed-to-converge maximum recomputation attempts.
                Default is 10.
            print_info (bool). Print time-stepping information. Default is False.
