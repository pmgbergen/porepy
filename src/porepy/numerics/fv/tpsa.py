                Should have length equal to the number of cells. If not provided, the

        # Overview of implementation: The implementation closely follows the description
        # of Tpsa given in the arXiv paper (see module-level documentation).
        # Specifically, the discretization is derived in appendix 2 therein, with some
        # central definition provided in Section 1. The ingredients of the
        # discretization are:
        # 1. Quantities related to bookkeeping, such as face and cell indices.
        # 2. Distance measures (e.g., cell-face) sometimes scaled with the shear
        #    modulus.
        # 3. Mappings that computes averages of cell-quantities and map them to faces.
        # 4. Specical treatment of boundary conditions.
        #
        # From these quantities, matrices that represent the different components of the
        # discretization can be constructed. The actual discretization matrices are
        # specified in Equation (A2.24) in the Tpsa paper (referring to the version
        # found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10390v2) for internal faces and (A2.28-31)
        # for boundary faces. Compared to the description in the paper, the
        # implementation uses a more explicit treatment of boundary conditions and
        # prefers more explicit naming of mathematical operators, but should otherwise
        # be equivalent.
        #
        # Specification of boundary conditions: Is the paper, the boundary conditions
        # are given on the form
        #
        #       b(\sigma_k * n_k - g^u) = 2\mu (g^u - u_k).
        #
        # Here, b is considered a length scale and is also denoted \delta_k^j (see the
        # bottom of page 10 in the arXiv version of the paper, link above). It is
        # understood that b = 0 gives a Dirichlet condition, b = infinity gives a
        # Neumann condition, and other values (positive and negative) form the Robin
        # case. In PorePy, Dirichlet and Neumann conditions are set separately, while
        # the Robin parameter, \alpha, is interpreted to be on the form
        #
        #       \sigma_k * n_k + \alpha u = g^u
        #
        # Thus, the PorePy \alpha corresponds to 2\mu / (\delta) in the paper.
        #
        # Implementation choices:
        # 1. To improve oversight of the implementation, it was decided to move
        #    computation of auxiliary quantities into static helper methods, and pass
        #    data around through helper dataclasses (namedtuples or dictionaries could
        #    also have been used). This is at times a bit awkward, but the alternative
        #    was a more chaotic implementation.
        # 2. Boundary conditions are implemented through a combination of filtering and
        #    average maps. This is in contrast to the tpsa paper, which presents a
        #    unified implementation of all types of boundary conditions based on the
        #    average maps. While this approach likely could have been followed to a
        #    larger degree, the more explicit treatment herein was preferred partly for
        #    ease of implementation and interpretation, and (honestly) partly for
        #    reasons of exhaustion on EK's part. For future reference, the most natural
        #    alternative approach is to introduce one weight each for Dirichlet and
        #    Neumann boundaries and let Robin be an average. The first step would be to
        #    verify that this does not introduce division by zero somewhere.
        #
        # Known shortcomings and known unknowns:
        # 1. The implementation of boundary conditions for the rotation variable covers
        #    only Neumann and Dirichlet conditions. Robin conditions should be feasible,
        #    but have not been prioritized.
        # 2. Robin conditions for the displacement variable is only implemented for a
        #    subset of the variations possible within PorePy. Errors are raised if the
        #    specified boundary condition fall outside the scope of the implementation.
        # 3. Non-homogeneous boundary conditions have generally not been thoroughly
        #    tested, mainly due to limited capacity. Such tests should be undertaken
        #    before the code is used for production purposes. EK's gut feeling in terms
        #    of the reliability of the different components is:
        #       * Internal faces (the main discretization) and homogeneous boundary
        #         conditions should be correct.
        #       * Non-zero Dirichlet and Neumann conditions are expected to be correct.
        #         Note however that this is mainly verified through unit tests that
        #         compared computed with numbers interpreted from the Tpsa paper for a
        #         specific geometr; see test_tpsa.py for details.
        #       * Non-zero Robin corrections should again be correct, with the same
        #         caveat as for Dirichlet and Neumann conditions. Since some additional
        #         interpretation is needed to translate Robin conditions between the
        #         formats in PorePy and the paper, the likelihood of bugs here is
        #         higher.
        #       * The functionality for boundary displacement recovery has not been
        #         tested. It should be correct for the easy case of Dirichlet
        #         conditions, quite likely also for Neumann conditions, while Robin
        #         should be considered a likely weak point.
        # 4. For the term 'mass_total_pressure', it is not clear how to interpret
        #    boundary conditions, and treatment of such conditions is therefore somewhat
        #    improvised. Plainly, EK does not know what to do here, but the current
        #    implementation seems to work. NOTE that this term acts as a numerical
        #    stabilization, and without it, oscillations may arise in the displacement
        #    variable. Thus, if oscillations are observed in the displacement close to
        #    the boundary, we may need to revisit this term.
