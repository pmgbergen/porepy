            scipy.sparse.csr_matrix (shape num_subcells * dim, num_cells):
            discretization of the jumps in [n alpha p] term,
            ready to be multiplied with inverse gradient
            scipy.sparse.csr_matrix (shape num_subfaces * dim, num_cells):
                discretization of the force on the face due to cell-centre
                pressure from a unique side.

        Method properties and implementation details.
        Basis functions, namely 'stress' and 'bound_stress', for the displacement
        discretization are obtained as in standard MPSA-W method.
        Pressure is represented as forces in the cells.
        However, jumps in pressure forces over a cell face act as force
        imbalance, and thus induce additional displacement gradients in the sub-cells.
        An additional system is set up, which applies non-zero conditions to the
        traction continuity equation. This can be expressed as a linear system on the form
            (i)   A * grad_u            = I
            (ii)  B * grad_u + C * u_cc = 0
            (iii) 0            D * u_cc = 0
        Thus (i)-(iii) can be inverted to express the additional displacement gradients
        due to imbalance in pressure forces as in terms of the cell center variables.
        Thus we can compute the basis functions 'grad_p_jumps' on the sub-cells.
        To ensure traction continuity, as soon as a convention is chosen for what side
        the force evaluation should be considered on, an additional term, called
        'grad_p_face', is added to the full force. This latter term represnts the force
        due to cell-center pressure acting on the face from the chosen side.
        The pair subfno_unique-unique_subfno gives the side convention.
        The full force on the face is therefore given by
        t = stress * u + bound_stress * u_b + (grad_p_jumps + grad_p_face) * p

        The strategy is as follows.
        1. compute product normal_vector * alpha and get a map for vector problems
        2. assemble r.h.s. for the new linear system, needed for the term 'grad_p_jumps'
        3. compute term 'grad_p_face'

                mixed-dimensional grid.
            grid_swap (boolean): If True, the grid g is identified with the @
                slave side of the mortar grid in data_adge.
            cc (block matrix, 3x3): Block matrix for the coupling condition.
                The first and second rows and columns are identified with the
                master and slave side; the third belongs to the edge variable.
                The discretization of the relevant term is done in-place in cc.
