""" Modules contains discretization of poro-elasticity by the multi-point stress
approximation.

The discretization scheme is described in

    J.M. Nordbotten (2016): STABLE CELL-CENTERED FINITE VOLUME DISCRETIZATION FOR BIOT
        EQUATIONS, SINUM.

The module contains four classes: Biot is the main class, responsible for discretization
of the poro-elastic system (relying heavily on its parent class pp.Mpsa). This is a
proper discretization class, in that it has discretize() and assemble_matrix_rhs()
methods.

The other classes, GradP, DivU and BiotStabilization, are containers for the other
terms in the poro-elasticity system. These have empty discretize() methods, and should
not be used directly.

Because of the number of variables and equations, and their somewhat difficult relation,
the most convenient way to set up a discertization for poro-elasticity is to use
pp.BiotContactMechanicsModel (designed for fractures and contact mechanics, but will
turn into a standard poro-elasticity equation for non-fractured domains).

        Method properties and implementation details.
        Basis functions, namely 'stress' and 'bound_stress', for the displacement
        discretization are obtained as in standard MPSA-W method.
        Pressure is represented as forces in the cells.
        However, jumps in pressure forces over a cell face act as force
        imbalance, and thus induce additional displacement gradients in the sub-cells.
        An additional system is set up, which applies non-zero conditions to the
        traction continuity equation. This can be expressed as a linear system on the form

            (i)   A * grad_u            = I
            (ii)  B * grad_u + C * u_cc = 0
            (iii) 0            D * u_cc = 0

        Thus (i)-(iii) can be inverted to express the additional displacement gradients
        due to imbalance in pressure forces as in terms of the cell center variables.
        Thus we can compute the basis functions 'grad_p_jumps' on the sub-cells.
        To ensure traction continuity, as soon as a convention is chosen for what side
        the force evaluation should be considered on, an additional term, called
        'grad_p_face', is added to the full force. This latter term represents the force
        due to cell-center pressure acting on the face from the chosen side.
        The pair subfno_unique-unique_subfno gives the side convention.
        The full force on the face is therefore given by

        t = stress * u + bound_stress * u_b + alpha * (grad_p_jumps + grad_p_face) * p

        The strategy is as follows.
        1. compute product normal_vector * alpha and get a map for vector problems
        2. assemble r.h.s. for the new linear system, needed for the term 'grad_p_jumps'
        3. compute term 'grad_p_face'
