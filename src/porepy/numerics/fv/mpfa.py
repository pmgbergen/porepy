        Discretize the scalar elliptic equation by the multi-point flux
        approximation method.
        The method computes fluxes over faces in terms of pressures in adjacent
        cells (defined as all cells sharing at least one vertex with the face).
        This corresponds to the MPFA-O method, see
        Aavatsmark (2002): An introduction to the MPFA-O method on
                quadrilateral grids, Comp. Geosci. for details.
        Implementation needs:
            1) The local linear systems should be scaled with the permeability and
            the local grid size, so that we avoid rounding errors accumulating
            under grid refinement / convergence tests.
            2) It probably makes sense to create a wrapper class to store the
            discretization, interface to linear solvers etc.
        Right now, there are concrete plans for 2).

        Parameters:
            g (pp.Grid): grid to be discretized
            k (pp.Second_order_tensor) permeability tensor. This is
                the effective permeability; for lower-dimensional grids, any
                aperture scaling of the permeability should be included in k.
            bnd (pp.BoundaryCondition) class for boundary values
            deviation_from_plane_tol: The geometrical tolerance, used in the check to
                rotate 2d grids
            eta Location of pressure continuity point. Defaults to 1/3 for simplex
                grids, 0 otherwise. On boundary faces with Dirichlet conditions,
                eta=0 will be enforced.
            eta_reconstruction Location of pressure reconstruction point on faces.
            inverter (string) Block inverter to be used, either numba (default),
                cython or python. See fvutils.invert_diagonal_blocks for details.
            max_memory (double): Threshold for peak memory during discretization.
                If the **estimated** memory need is larger than the provided
                threshold, the discretization will be split into an appropriate
                number of sub-calculations, using mpfa_partial().

                discretization, in the form of mapping from cell pressures to face

            scipy.sparse.csr_matrix (shape num_faces, num_faces): discretization of
                boundary conditions. Interpreted as fluxes induced by the boundary
                condition (both Dirichlet and Neumann). For Neumann, this will be
                the prescribed flux over the boundary face, and possibly fluxes
                over faces having nodes on the boundary. For Dirichlet, the values
                will be fluxes induced by the prescribed pressure. Incorporation as
                a right hand side in linear system by multiplication with
                divergence operator.
            scipy.sparse.csr_matrix (shape num_faces, num_cells): Used to recover
                pressure on boundary faces. Contribution from computed cell
                pressures only; contribution from faces (below) also needed.
            scipy.sparse.csr_matrix (shape num_faces, num_faces): Used to recover

        Actual implementation of the MPFA O-method. To calculate MPFA on a grid
        directly, either call this method, or, to respect the privacy of this
        method, the main mpfa method with no memory constraints.

        Method properties and implementation details.

        The pressure is discretized as a linear function on sub-cells (see
        reference paper). In this implementation, the pressure is represented by
        its cell center value and the sub-cell gradients (this is in contrast to
        most papers, which use auxiliary pressures on the faces; the current
        formulation is equivalent, but somewhat easier to implement).
        The method will give continuous fluxes over the faces, and pressure
        continuity for certain points (controlled by the parameter eta). This can
        be expressed as a linear system on the form

            (i)    A * grad_p              = 0
            (ii)   Ar * grad_p + Cr * p_cc = 0
            (iii)  B  * grad_p + C  * p_cc = 0
            (iv)   0             D  * p_cc = I

        Here, the first equation represents flux continuity, and involves only the
        pressure gradients (grad_p). The second equation gives the Robin conditions,
        relating flux to the pressure. The third equation gives pressure continuity
        over interior faces, thus B will contain distances between cell centers and the
        face continuity points, while C consists of +- 1 (depending on which side
        the cell is relative to the face normal vector). The fourth equation
        enforces the pressure to be unity in one cell at a time. Thus (i)-(iv) can
        be inverted to express the pressure gradients in terms of the cell
        center variables, that is, we can compute the basis functions on the
        sub-cells. Because of the method construction (again see reference paper),
        the basis function of a cell c will be non-zero on all sub-cells sharing
        a vertex with c. Finally, the fluxes as functions of cell center values are
        computed by insertion into Darcy's law (which is essentially half of A from
        (i), that is, only consider contribution from one side of the face.
        Boundary values can be incorporated with appropriate modifications -
        Neumann conditions will have a non-zero right hand side for (i), while
        Dirichlet gives a right hand side for (iii).

        #     third row are eliminated (there is no Robin or pressure continuity
        #     condition).
        #  ii) Robin conditions have dedicated rows, these subfaces are eliminated
        #      from the first and third row.
        #  iii) For Dirichlet subfaces, only the third block row is kept.

        # representing the x-component etc.

        # with node ni, first find the indexes of subcell_topology.cno and .nno
        # that contain ci and ni, respectively. The first of these indexes give the
        # row of the x-component of the gradient, the second the y-component etc.

        # The columns of igrad correspond to the ordering of the equations in
        # grad; as recovered in _block_diagonal_structure. In practice, the first
        # columns correspond to unit pressures assigned to faces (as used for
        # boundary conditions or to discretize discontinuities over internal faces,
        # say, to represent heterogeneous gravity), while the latter group
        # gives gradients induced by cell center pressures.
        #
        # Note tacit assumptions: 1) Each cell has exactly Nd faces meeting in a
        # vertex; or else, there would not be an exact match between the
        # number of equal (nno-cno) pairs and the number of components in the
        # gradient. This assumption is always okay in 2d, in 3d it rules out cells
        # shaped as pyramids, in which case mpfa is not defined without making
        # further specifications of the method.
        # 2) The number of components in the gradient is equal to the spatial
        # dimension of the grid, as defined in g.dim. Thus 2d grids embedded in 3d
        # will run into trouble, unless the grid is first projected down to its
        # natural plane. This can be fixed by a more general implementation, but
