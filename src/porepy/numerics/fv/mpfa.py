        cells (defined as all cells sharing at least one vertex with the face).
        This corresponds to the MPFA-O method, see
        Aavatsmark (2002): An introduction to the MPFA-O method on
                quadrilateral grids, Comp. Geosci. for details.
        Implementation needs:
            1) The local linear systems should be scaled with the permeability and
            the local grid size, so that we avoid rounding errors accumulating
            under grid refinement / convergence tests.
            2) It probably makes sense to create a wrapper class to store the
            discretization, interface to linear solvers etc.
        Right now, there are concrete plans for 2).

        Parameters:
            g (core.grids.grid): grid to be discretized
            k (core.constit.second_order_tensor) permeability tensor
            bnd (core.bc.bc) class for boundary values
            eta Location of pressure continuity point. Defaults to 1/3 for simplex
                grids, 0 otherwise. On boundary faces with Dirichlet conditions,
                eta=0 will be enforced.
            inverter (string) Block inverter to be used, either numba (default),
                cython or python. See fvutils.invert_diagonal_blocks for details.
            apertures (np.ndarray) apertures of the cells for scaling of the face
                normals.
            max_memory (double): Threshold for peak memory during discretization.
                If the **estimated** memory need is larger than the provided
                threshold, the discretization will be split into an appropriate

                boundary conditions. Interpreted as fluxes induced by the boundary
                condition (both Dirichlet and Neumann). For Neumann, this will be
                the prescribed flux over the boundary face, and possibly fluxes
                over faces having nodes on the boundary. For Dirichlet, the values

        Actual implementation of the MPFA O-method. To calculate MPFA on a grid
        directly, either call this method, or, to respect the privacy of this
        method, the main mpfa method with no memory constraints.
        Method properties and implementation details.
        The pressure is discretized as a linear function on sub-cells (see
        reference paper). In this implementation, the pressure is represented by
        its cell center value and the sub-cell gradients (this is in contrast to
        most papers, which use auxiliary pressures on the faces; the current
        formulation is equivalent, but somewhat easier to implement).
        The method will give continuous fluxes over the faces, and pressure
        continuity for certain points (controlled by the parameter eta). This can
        be expressed as a linear system on the form
            (i)    A * grad_p              = 0
            (ii)   Ar * grad_p + Cr * P_cc = 0
            (iii)  B * grad_p + C * p_cc   = 0
            (iv)   0            D * p_cc   = I
        Here, the first equation represents flux continuity, and involves only the
        pressure gradients (grad_p). The second equation gives the Robin conditions,
        relating flux to the pressure. The third equation gives pressure continuity
        over cell faces, thus B will contain distances between cell centers and the
        face continuity points, while C consists of +- 1 (depending on which side
        the cell is relative to the face normal vector). The fourth equation
        enforces the pressure to be unity in one cell at a time. Thus (i)-(iv) can
        be inverted to express the pressure gradients as in terms of the cell
        center variables, that is, we can compute the basis functions on the
        sub-cells. Because of the method construction (again see reference paper),
        the basis function of a cell c will be non-zero on all sub-cells sharing
        a vertex with c. Finally, the fluxes as functions of cell center values are
        computed by insertion into Darcy's law (which is essentially half of A from
        (i), that is, only consider contribution from one side of the face.
        Boundary values can be incorporated with appropriate modifications -
        Neumann conditions will have a non-zero right hand side for (i), while
        Dirichlet gives a right hand side for (iii).
