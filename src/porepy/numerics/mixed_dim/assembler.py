        For nodes and internally to edges in the GridBucket (i.e. fixed-dimensional grids),

        and the name of term (all of which are defined in the data dictionary

            - An advection-diffusion equation will typically have two terms, say,
                advection_temperature, diffusion_temperature
            - For a coupled flow-temperature discretization, the coupling (off-diagonal)
                terms may have identifiers 'coupling_temperature_flow' and
                'coupling_flow_temperature'

        For couplings between edges and nodes, a three variable combination is needed,
        identifying variable names on the edge and the respective neighboring nodes.

        For examples on how to use the assembler, confer the tutorial
        parameter_assignment_assembler_setup.ipynb. Here, we list the main capabilities
        of the assembler:
            * Assign an arbitrary number of variables on each node and edge in the grid
              bucket. Allow for general couplings between the variables internal to each
              node / edge.
            * Assign general coupling schemes between edges and one or both neighboring
              nodes. There are no limitations on variable naming conventions in the
              coupling.
            * Construct a system matrix that only consideres a subset of the variables
              defined in the GridBucket data dictionary.
            * Return either a single discretization matrix covering all variables and
              terms, or one matrix per term per variable. The latter is useful e.g. in
              operator splitting or time stepping schemes.

        The latter two effects can be achieved by applying a filter to the assembly
        operation, see for instance pp.assembler_filters.ListFilter.

        In all cases, it is assumed that a discretization object for the relevant terms
        is available. It is up to the user to ensure that the resulting problem is
        well posed.

        Parameters:
            filt (pp.assembler_filters.AssemblerFilter, optional): Filter to invoke
                selected discretizations. Defaults to a PassAllFilter, which will
                lead to discretization of all terms in the entire GridBucket.
            matrix_format (str, optional): Matrix format used for the system matrix.
                Defaults to CSR.
            add_matrices (boolean, optional): If True, a single system matrix is added,
                else, separate matrices for each variable and term are returned in a
                dictionary.
            only_matrix (boolean, optional). If True, only the matrix will be assembled.
                Note that some discretization methods will still invoke its full
                assemble_matrix_rhs method. This method will still return a (zero)
                rhs vector.
            only_rhs (boolean, optional). If True, only the rhs will be assembled.

                dictionary is returned if add_matrices=False.

        Parameters:
            operation (str): Should be 'assemble' or 'discretize'.
            matrix (dict): Dictionary that maps strings of variable combinations to the
                block matrix. The keys are variable combinations, found in
                self.variable_combinations. The values are block matrices, stored as
                np.ndarrays, with each array item defined as a sps.spmatrix.
                Only needed if operation == 'assemble'.
            rhs (dict): Dictionary that maps strings of variable combinations to the
                block rhsx. The keys are variable combinations, found in
                self.variable_combinations. The values are block vectors, stored as
                np.ndarrays, with each array item defined as an np.ndarray.
                Only needed if operation == 'assemble'.
            sps_matrix(csc or csr sparse matrix): The sparse matrix format.
                Should be csc or csr.

            variable_filter, term_filter: Parameters that can be used for
                partial discretization or assembly. The usage of these terms is
                currently unclear. Use with care.

        Initialize local matrices for all combinations of variables and operators.

        The function serves two purposes:
            1. Identify all variables and their discretizations defined on individual nodes
               and edges in the GridBucket
            2. To each combination of a node / edge, and a variable, assign an
               index. This will define the ordering of the blocks in the system matrix.

        At the end of this function, self has been assigned three attributes:
            block_dof: Is a dictionary with keys that are either
                Tuple[pp.Grid, variable_name: str] for nodes in the GridBucket, or
                Tuple[Tuple[pp.Grid, pp.Grid], str] for edges in the GridBucket.

                The values in block_dof are integers 0, 1, ..., that identify the block
                index of this specific grid (or edge) - variable combination.

            full_dof: Is a np.ndarray of int that store the number of degrees of
                freedom per key-item pair in block_dof. Thus
                  len(full_dof) == len(block_dof).
                The total size of the global system is full_dof.sum()

            variable_combinations: Is a list of strings that define all couplings of
                variables found in the problem specification. This includes both
                diagonal terms in the system block matrix, coupling terms within nodes

        Initialize a set of matrices (for left hand sides) and vectors (rhs)
        for all operators associated with a variable (example: a temperature
        variable in an advection-diffusion problem will typically have two
        operators, one for advection, one for diffusion).

        It is useful to differ between the discretization matrices of different
        variables and terms for at least two reasons:
          1) It is useful in time stepping methods, where only some terms
             are time dependent
          2) In some discretization schemes, the coupling discretization can
             override discretizations on the neighboring nodes. It is critical
             that this only overrides values associated with the relevant terms.
        We therefore generate one discretization matrix and right hand side
        per term, as identified in variable_combinations.

        NOTE: It is possible to construct cases where variable and discretization
        names give unfortunate consequences. However, it does not seem worth
        the effort to split the matrix even further.

        Parameters:
            sps_matrix (class): Class for sparse matrices, used to initialize
                individual blocks in the matrix.
