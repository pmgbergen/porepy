            - An advection-diffusion equation will typically have two terms, say,

        of the assembler:
            * Assign an arbitrary number of variables on each node and edge in the grid
              bucket. Allow for general couplings between the variables internal to each
              node / edge.
            * Assign general coupling schemes between edges and one or both neighboring
              nodes. There are no limitations on variable naming conventions in the
              coupling.
            * Construct a system matrix that only consideres a subset of the variables
              defined in the GridBucket data dictionary.
            * Return either a single discretization matrix covering all variables and
              terms, or one matrix per term per variable. The latter is useful e.g. in
              operator splitting or time stepping schemes.

        In all cases, it is assumed that a discretization object for the relevant terms
        is available. It is up to the user to ensure that the resulting problem is
        well posed.

        Parameters:
            matrix_format (str, optional): Matrix format used for the system matrix.
                Defaults to CSR.
            add_matrices (boolean, optional): If True, a single system matrix is added,
                else, separate matrices for each variable and term are returned in a
                dictionary.

        Returns:
            scipy sparse matrix, or dictionary of matrices: Discretization matrix,
                dictionary is returned if add_matrices=False.

        Only active variables will be considered. Moreover, the discretization
        operation can be filtered to only consider specified variables, or terms.
        If the variable filter is active, only discretizations where all variables
        survive the filter will be discretized (for diagonal terms, the variable
        must survive, for off-diagonal terms, both terms must survive).

        Filtering on terms works on the more detailed levels of indivdiual terms
        in a multi-physics discretization (say, zoom-in on the advection term
        in a advection-diffusion system).

        The filters can be combined to select specified terms for specified equations.
        See examples 1 and 2.

        -- Experimental feature --
        If you pass a filter where each item is prefixed by "!", this is interpreted as
        exclusion. Then every variable/term will be discretized except those present in
        the filter. See example 3 and 4.

        Parameters
        ----------
        variable_filter : List[str] (optional)
            List of variables to be discretized. If None (default), all active
            variables are discretized.
        term_filter : List[str] (optional)
            List of terms to be discretized. If None (default), all terms for
            all active variables are discretized.
        grid : List[pp.Grid] (optional)
            Grids in GridBucket. If specified, only these grids will be considered.
        edges : bool (optional)
            If True (default), terms on edges and coupling terms are discretized.
            As these typically are cheaper than grid discretizations, the
            operation cannot be filtered on specific edges.

        Examples
        --------

        1) Example (discretization internal to a node or edge):
            For a discretizaiton of the form

            data[pp.DISCRETIZATION] = {'temp': {'advection': Foo(), 'diffusion': Bar()},
                                       'pressure' : {'diffusion': FlowFoo()}}

            a) variable_filter = ['temp'] will discretize all temp terms

            b) term_filter = ['diffusion'] will discretize duffusion for both the temp and
                pressure variable

            c) variable_filter = ['temp'], term_filter = ['diffusion'] will only discretize
                the diffusion term for variable temp

            * Experimental: *
            d) variable_filter = ['!temp'] will only discretize the pressure terms.

            e) term_filter = ['!diffusion'] will only discretize the advection term of the
                pressure variable.

        2) Example (coupling terms):
            Variable filter works as internal to nodes / edges.
            The term filter acts on the identifier of a coupling, so

            d[pp.COUPLING_DISCRETIZATION] = {'coupling_id' : {g1: {'temp': 'diffusion'},
                                                              g2:  {'pressure': 'diffusion'},
                                                              (g1, g2): {'coupling_variable': FooBar()}}}

            will survive term_filter = ['coupling_id']

            1. Identify all variables and their discretizations defined on individual nodes
               and edges in the GridBucket
            2. To each combination of a node / edge, and a variable, assign an
               index. This will define the ordering of the blocks in the system matrix.

                The values in block_dof are integers 0, 1, ..., that identify the block
                index of this specific grid (or edge) - variable combination.

            full_dof: Is a np.ndarray of int that store the number of degrees of
                freedom per key-item pair in block_dof. Thus
                  len(full_dof) == len(block_dof).
                The total size of the global system is full_dof.sum()

            variable_combinations: Is a list of strings that define all couplings of
                variables found in the problem specification. This includes both
                diagonal terms in the system block matrix, coupling terms within nodes

        Initialize a set of matrices (for left hand sides) and vectors (rhs)
        for all operators associated with a variable (example: a temperature
        variable in an advection-diffusion problem will typically have two
        operators, one for advection, one for diffusion).

        It is useful to differ between the discretization matrices of different
        variables and terms for at least two reasons:
          1) It is useful in time stepping methods, where only some terms
             are time dependent
          2) In some discretization schemes, the coupling discretization can
             override discretizations on the neighboring nodes. It is critical
             that this only overrides values associated with the relevant terms.
        We therefore generate one discretization matrix and right hand side
        per term, as identified in variable_combinations.

        NOTE: It is possible to construct cases where variable and discretization
        names give unfortunate consequences. However, it does not seem worth
        the effort to split the matrix even further.

            sps_matrix (class): Class for sparse matrices, used to initialize
