    for the individual terms in the equation must be defined and follow certain

        For nodes and internally to edges in the GridBucket (i.e. fixed-dimensional grids),
        the variable name is formed by combining the name of one or two primary variables,
        and the name of term (all of which are defined in the data dictionary
        of this node / edge. As examples:
            - An advection-diffusion equation will typically have two terms, say,
                advection_temperature, diffusion_temperature
            - For a coupled flow-temperature discretization, the coupling (off-diagonal)
                terms may have identifiers 'coupling_temperature_flow' and
                'coupling_flow_temperature'

        For couplings between edges and nodes, a three variable combination is needed,
        identifying variable names on the edge and the respective neighboring nodes.

        NOTE: The naming of variables and terms are left to the user. For examples
        on how to set this up, confer the tutorial parameter_asignment_assembler_setup

        Parameters:
            term (str): Identifier of a discretization operation.

            key_2 (str): Variable name

        multi-physics problem, and return a block matrix and right hand side.

        For examples on how to use the assembler, confer the tutorial
        parameter_assignment_assembler_setup.ipynb. Here, we list the main capabilities
        of the assembler:
            * Assign an arbitrary number of variables on each node and edge in the grid
              bucket. Allow for general couplings between the variables internal to each
              node / edge.
            * Assign general coupling schemes between edges and one or both neighboring
              nodes. There are no limitations on variable naming conventions in the
              coupling.
            * Construct a system matrix that only consideres a subset of the variables
              defined in the GridBucket data dictionary.
            * Return either a single discretization matrix covering all variables and
              terms, or one matrix per term per variable. The latter is useful e.g. in
              operator splitting or time stepping schemes.

        In all cases, it is assumed that a discretization object for the relevant terms
        is available. It is up to the user to ensure that the resulting problem is
        well posed.

        Parameters:
            gb (pp.GridBucket): Mixed-dimensional grid where the equations are
                discretized. The data dictionaries on nodes and edges should contain
                variable and discretization information, see tutorial for details.
            matrix_format (str, optional): Matrix format used for the system matrix.
                Defaults to CSR.
            active_variables (list of str, optional): Names of variables to be assembled.
                If provided, only decleared primary variables with a name found in the
                list will be assembled, and the size of the matrix will be reduced
                accordingly.
            add_matrices (boolean, optional): If True, a single system matrix is added,
                else, separate matrices for each variable and term are returned in a
                dictionary.

        Returns:
            scipy sparse matrix, or dictionary of matrices: Discretization matrix,
                dictionary is returned if add_matrices=False.
            np.ndarray, or dictionary of arrays: Right hand side terms. Dictionary is
                returned if add_matrices=False.
            dictionary: Mapping from GridBucket nodes / edges + variables to the
                corresponding block index. The keys on a node is defined by tuples
                (grid, variable_name), while on an edge e, the key is (e, variable_name).
            np.ndarray: For each matrix block, the number of degrees of freedom.

        """
        Initialize local matrices for all combinations of variables and operators.

        The function serves three purposes:
            1. Identify all variables and their discretizations defined on individual nodes
               and edges in the GridBucket
            2. To each combination of a node / edge, and a variable, assign an
               index. This will define the ordering of the blocks in the system matrix.
            3. Initialize a set of matrices (for left hand sides) and vectors (rhs)
               for all operators associated with a variable (example: a temperature
               variable in an advection-diffusion problem will typically have two
               operators, one for advection, one for diffusion).

        It is useful to differ between the discretization matrices of different
        variables and terms for at least two reasons:
          1) It is useful in time stepping methods, where only some terms
             are time dependent
          2) In some discretization schemes, the coupling discretization can
             override discretizations on the neighboring nodes. It is critical
             that this only overrides values associated with the relevant terms.
        We therefore generate one discretization matrix and right hand side
        per term, as identified in variable_combinations.
        NOTE: It is possible to construct cases where variable and discretization
        names give unfortunate consequences. However, it does not seem worth
        the effort to split the matrix even further.

        Parameters:
            gb (GridBukcet): Mixed-dimensional grid.
            active_variables (list of str): Name of active variables. If empty,
                or None, all variables are considered active.
            sps_matrix (class): Class for sparse matrices, used to initialize
                individual blokcs in the matrix.

        Returns:
            dict: Global system matrices, on block form (one per node/edge per
                variable). There is one item per term (e.g. diffusion/advection)
                per variable.
            dict: Right hand sides. Similar to the system matrix.
            dict: Giving the block index of a variable on a specific node/edge.
                The dictionary keys take the form of a tuple (grid, variable_name)
                on GridBucket nodes, (edge, variable_name) on edges.
            np.array: For each variable on each node/edge, the number of dofs
                needed.
