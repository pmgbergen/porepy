""" Discretization filters to allow partial discretization or assembly.

Content:
    AllPassFilter does no filtering.
    ListFilter: filters based on grid quantities, variables and lists.

New filter classes should be implemented by subclassing the abstract base
class AssemblerFilter.

    The filter is initialized with lists of grids (specification below),
    variabels and terms that should pass the filter. The filter function will pass a
    combination of a grid, a set of variables and a term if they are all found
    in the lists of acceptables.

    If a list of grids, variables and/or  terms are not provided at the time of
    initialization, all objects of this the unspecified type will pass the filter.
    Thus, if neither grids, variables nor terms are specified, the filter effectively
    becomes an AllPassFilter.

    Acceptable variables and terms can be specified as a negation with the
    syntax !variable_name. It is not possible to use both negated and standard
    specification of, say, variables, but negated variables combined with standard
    terms (or reverse) is permissible.

    The generalized grids should be one of
        i) grids: nodes in the GridBucket
        ii) interfaces: (Grid, Grid) tuples, edges in the GridBucket.
        iii) couplings: (Grid, Grid, (Grid, Grid)) tuples, so an edge, together
            with its neighboring subdomains.
