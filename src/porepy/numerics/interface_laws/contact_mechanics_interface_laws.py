    The primary variables for this formulation are displacement in the ambient dimension,
    displacements at the boundary of the highest dimensional grid (represented as mortar
    variables), and contact forces on grids of co-dimension 1.

    The conditions represented here are
        1) KKT condition for the traction / displacement in the normal direction.
        2) Conditions for the tangential traction / displacement, according
           to whether the fracture is sliding, sticking or free.
        3) Linear elasticity on the surface displacements, with the tangential contact
           force as a driving force.
        4) The mortar displacements act as Dirichlet boundary conditions for the
           higher-dimensional domain.

    When solving contact problems, the sought fracture displacement (jumps) are defined
    relative to an initial state. For transient problems, this initial state is the
    solution at the previous time step. The state should be available in
        d[pp.STATE][self.mortar_displacement_variable],
