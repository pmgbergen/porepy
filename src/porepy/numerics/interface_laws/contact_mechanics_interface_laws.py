    The primary variables for this formulation are displacement in the ambient dimension,
    displacements at the boundary of the highest dimensional grid (represented as mortar

    The conditions represented here are
        1) KKT condition for the traction / displacement in the normal direction.
        2) Conditions for the tangential traction / displacement, according
           to whether the fracture is sliding, sticking or free.
