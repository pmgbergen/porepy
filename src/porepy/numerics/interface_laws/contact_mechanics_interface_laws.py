    The primary variables for this formulation are displacement in the ambient dimension,
    displacements at the boundary of the highest dimensional grid (represented as mortar

    The conditions represented here are
        1) KKT condition for the traction / displacement in the normal direction.
        2) Conditions for the tangential traction / displacement, according
           to whether the fracture is sliding, sticking or free.

    MatrixPressureToForceBalance.

    For the contact mechanics, we only want to consider the _contact_ traction. Thus, we
    have to subtract the pressure contribution, i.e.

        T_contact - p_check I \dot n = boundary_traction_hat,

    since the full tractions experienced by a fracture surface are the sum of the
