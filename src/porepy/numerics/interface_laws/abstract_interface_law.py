        Intended use is when the discretization should be updated, e.g. because of

        will be when the discretization operation is costly, and only a minor update
        is necessary.

        The updates can generally come as a combination of two forms:
            1) The discretization on part of the grid should be recomputed.
            2) The old discretization can be used (in parts of the grid), but the

               reorder accordingly.

        """Method to assemble the contribution from one interface to another one.

        The method must be implemented for subclasses of AbstractInterfaceLaw which has
        the attribute intf_coupling_via_low_dim set to True. For classes where the
        variable is False, there is no need for action.

        Note that the mixed-dimensional modeling framework does not allow for direct
        couplings between interfaces. However, there may be cases where an interface law
        is dependent on variables on the boundary between the lower-dimensional
        grid and another interface. As we normally associate these boundary values
        with the variable on the secondary interface, this method is available
        as an alternative.

        For more details on how this function is invoked see pp.Assembler.
        Note that the coupling currently only can be invoked if the variables
        on the primary and secondary interface have the same name.

        Any discretization operation should be done as part of self.discretize().

        Parameters:
            g_between (pp.Grid): Grid of the lower-dimensional neighbor to the
                main interface
            data_between (dict): Data dictionary of the intermediate grid.
            intf_primary (tuple of grids): The grids of the primary interface
            data_intf_primary (dict): Data dictionary of the primary interface.
            intf_secondary (tuple of grids): The grids of the secondary interface.
            data_intf_secondary (dict): Data dictionary of the secondary interface.
            matrix: original discretization.
            assemble_matrix (optional): If True (defalut), contributions to local matrix
                are assembled.
            assemble_rhs (optional): If True (defalut), contributions to local rhs
                are assembled.

        Returns:
            np.array: Block matrix of size 3 x 3, whwere each block represents
                coupling between variables on this interface. Index 0, 1 and 2
                represent the primary, secondary and mortar variable, respectively.
            np.array: Block matrix of size 3 x 1, representing the right hand
                side of this coupling. Index 0, 1 and 2 represent the primary,
                secondary and mortar variable, respectively.
