For details on the conditions discretized herein, see

Berge et al., 2019: Finite volume discretization for poroelastic media with fractures
modeled by contact mechanics.

When solving contact problems, the sought fracture displacement (jumps) are defined
relative to an initial state. For transient problems, this initial state is the solution
at the previous time step. The state should be available in

    d[pp.STATE][self.mortar_displacement_variable],

and may usually be set to zero for stationary problems. The ColoumbContact
discretization operates on relative tangential jumps and absolute normal jumps.

        approach.

        The function relates the contact forces, represented on the
        lower-dimensional grid, to the jump in displacement between the two
        adjacent mortar grids. The function provides a (linearized)
        disrcetizaiton of the contact conditions, as described in Berge et al.

        The discertization is stated in the coordinate system defined by the
        projection operator associated with the surface. The contact forces
        should be interpreted as tangential and normal to this plane.

        NOTES:
            Quantities stated in the global coordinate system (e.g.
        displacements on the adjacent mortar grids) must be projected to the
        local system, using the same projection operator, when paired with the
        produced discretization (that is, in the global assembly).
            There is a numerical parameter c_num. The sensitivity is currently
        unknown.

        Assumptions and other noteworthy aspects:  TODO: Rewrite this when the
        implementation is ready.
            * The contact surface is planar, so that all cells on the surface can
            be described by a single normal vector.
            * The contact forces are represented directly in the local
            coordinate system of the surface. The first self.dim - 1 elements
            of the contact vector are the tangential components of the first
            cell, then the normal component, then tangential of the second cell
            etc.

        # normal vector is done in the construction of the projection object

        # first element in faces_on_surface, there is no guarantee that this will
        # give us a face on the positive (or negative) side, hence the more general
        # approach is preferred.
