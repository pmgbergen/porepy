class MobilityCF:
    """Mixin class defining mobilities for the balance equations in the CF setting, and
    which discretization is to be used for the magnitude of terms in the compositional
    flow and transport model.

    The flexibility is required due to the varying mathematical nature of the pressure
    equation, energy balance and transport equations.

    They also need all separate instances of the discretization objects to avoid
    false storage access.

    Discretizations handled by this class include those for the non-linear weights in
    various flux terms.

    Flux discretizations are handled by respective constitutive laws.

    Important:
        Mobility terms are designed to be representable also on boundary grids.
        **This is intended for the Dirichlet boundary where a value is required for e.g.
        upwinding.**

        Values on the Neumann boundary (especially fractional mobilities) must be
        implemented by the user in :class:`BoundaryConditionsCompositionalFlow`.
        Those values are then consequently multiplied with boundary flux values in
        respective balance equations.

class BoundaryConditionsCompositionalFlow(

):
    """Mixin treating boundary conditions for the compositional flow.

    Atop of inheriting the treatment for single phase flow (which is exploited for the
    total mass balance) and the energy balance (total energy balance), this class has
    a treatment for BC for component mass balances, and secondary expressions.

    **If model has equilibrium conditions and a flash instance:**

    This class provides the :meth:`boundary_flash` method which computes the flash on
    the Dirichlet boundary for pressure, requiring also temperature values there.

    The result is used to populate various secondary expressions and to provide values
    for fractional variables on the boundary. The secondary expressions play a role
    within the mobility terms.

    The boundary flash uses the framework of secondary expressions to set boundary
    values directly.

    Note:
        This method performs the boundary flash in every time-step, only if the modeler
        has explicitely defined if the problem has time-dependent BC
        (see :attr:`has_time_dependent_boundary_equilibrium`).

        The first boundary equilibrium is performed anyways in the solution strategy, to
        cover the case of constant BC.

        This is for performance reasons.

    **If the model has no equilibrium conditions and flash defined:**

    The user must provide values for fractional variables and secondary expressions on
    the Dirichlet boundary, which appear in the weights for fluxes
    (only advective as of now). They are required for upwinding.

    For convenience, they can be stored in :attr:`boundary_fluid_state`.

    **Values which always need to be provided:**

    Overall fractions of components on the Dirichlet boundary (to compute the boundary
    flash), and fractional mobility values on the Neumann boundary.
    This somewhat unusual requirement for the mobility is due to the framework accessing
    the Neumann flux from single phase flow as BC, and then weighing it with the
    provided values in the flux terms in component mass and energy balance.

    Important:
        The Dirichlet boundary is solely defined by
        :meth:`~porepy.models.fluid_mass_balance.BoundaryConditionsSinglePhaseFlow.
        bc_type_darcy_flux`.

        This class goes as far as overriding the parent method
        :meth:`~porepy.models.fluid_mass_balance.BoundaryConditionsSinglePhaseFlow.
        bc_type_fluid_flux` and calling the ``bc_type_darcy_flux`` instead to provide
        a consistent representation of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary.

        This is also done for
        :meth:`~porepy.models.energy_balance.BoundaryConditionsEnergyBalance.
        bc_type_enthalpy_flux`.

        It is an inconsistency which probably should be removed in the parent classes.
        TODO

    Important:
        The boundary flash requires Dirichlet data for temperature as well, independent
        of how the boundary type for the Fourier flux is defined.
        This class implements a p-T flash on the Dirichlet boundary for the advective
        flux.

    Notes:

        1. BC values for the fluid enthalpy (which is an independent variable) are not
           required, since it only appears in the accumulation term of the energy
           balance.

        2. BC values for thermal conductivity are also not required, because of the
           nature of the Fourier flux.

        3. Derivative values of secondary expressions are not required on the boundary
           as of now, since they do not appear anywhere.

        consistency.

        This method implements certain requirements to how the model is configured,
        aiming for complete mathematical consistency.

        Checks:

        1. Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin faces must be consistently defined for all advective
           fluxes.
        2. Dirichlet faces for the advective flux (where temperature must also be
           defined on the boundary to compute the advective weights), must be contained
           in the Dirichlet faces for the Fourier flux (important!)
        3. Fractional mobilities on boundaries must add up to 1 or be zero.
        4. Overall fractions on boundaries must add up to 1 or be zero.
        5. Pressure, temperature and overall fraction values on Dirichlet boundary must
           be strictly positive or zero on the same faces (boundary flash).

        While most of the checks are straight forward, check 2 needs an explanation:

        On Dirichlet faces for the Darcy flux, pressure must be provided, and a way
        to compute the weights in the advective flux.
        Since in the non-isothermal setting the fluid properties depend also on T,
        the user must provide T values there as well.

        Also, the conductive flux in the energy equation on this part of the boundary
        must hence not be given by Neumann conditions, but be consistent since T is
        provided.

        To summarize, on the boundary with pressure defined, temperature must be defined
        as well to compute the propertie. And since temperature is given, the Fourier
        flux cannot have Neumann values on those faces.

        Note though, that temperature can be defined on faces, where there are no
        Dirichlet conditions for pressure. This gives flexibility to define heated
        boundaries with no mass flux, in terms of both temperature and heat flux.

    This mixin is introduced because of the complexity of the framework, guiding the

    executed in the model set-up.

    All method herein are part of the routine
    :meth:`SolutionStrategyCompositionalFlow.initial_conditions`.

    The basic initialization assumes that initial conditions are given in terms of

    - pressure,
    - temperature,
    - feed fractions,

    and that equilibrium calculations are included in the model.

    I.e., a flash is performed.
    More precisely, it assumes that initial conditions are given for feed fractions,
    pressure and temperature.

    Everything else is computed using the flash algorithm to provide values for
    fractions.

    The primary, transportable variables are:

    - pressure
    - (specific molar) enthalpy of the mixture
    - ``num_comp - 1 `` overall fractions per independent component

    The secondary, local variables are:

    - ``num_phases - 1`` saturations per independent phase
    - ``num_phases - 1`` molar phase fractions per independent phase
    - ``num_phases * num_comp`` extended fractions of components in phases
    - temperature

    The primary block of equations consists of:

    - pressure equation / transport of total mass
    - energy balance / transport of total energy
    - ``num_comp - 1`` transport equations for each independent component

    The secondary block of equations represents the local equilibrium problem formulated
    as a unified p-h flash:

    - ``num_comp - 1`` local mass conservation equations for each independent component
    - ``num_comp * (num_phase - 1)`` isofugacity constraints
    - ``num_phases`` semi-smooth complementarity conditions for each phase
    - local enthalpy constraint (equating mixture enthalpy with transported enthalpy)
    - ``num_phase - 1`` density relations per independent phase

    In total the model encompasses
    ``3 + num_comp - 1 + num_comp * num_phases + 2 * (num_phases - 1)`` equations und
    DOFs per cell in each subdomains, excluding the unknowns on interfaces.

    Example:
        For the most simple model set-up, make a mixture mixing defining the components
        and phases, and derive a flow model from it.

        Instantiate the model with ```equilbrium_type`=None``, i.e. no local
        thermodynamic equilibrium calculations.
        This is essentially a multiphase flow without phase change.
