flow (CF).

Provides means to formulate pressure equation, mass balance equations per component

Primary variables are pressure, specific fluid enthalpy and overall fractions,
as well as solute fractions for purely transpored solutes.

By default, the model is not closed, since saturations and temperature are dangling

The user needs to close models by providing a constitutive expression
for them and eliminating the variables by a local, algebraic equation.

class BoundaryConditionsCF(

):
    """Mixin treating boundary conditions for the compositional flow.

    Atop of inheriting the treatment for single phase flow (which is exploited for the
    total mass balance) and the energy balance (total energy balance), this class has
    a treatment for BC for fractional unknowns and phase properties as secondary
    expressions.

    **Essential BC**:

    Essential BC denote the values of primary variables on the Dirichlet boundary,
    and flux values (Darcy + Fourier) on the Neumann boundary.

    They must be provided for all set-ups.

    **BC values for constitutively eliminated variables**:

    If a variable was eliminated using
    :meth:`SecondaryEquationsMixin.eliminate_by_constitutive_law` on a boundary grid,
    the passed function is used to evaluate and store its value on the boundary.
    This assumes the BC values for its dependencies are also provided.

    **BC Values for thermodynamic properties of phases**:

    If the user choce to pass ``'use_fractional_flow_bc' == False`` as a model
    parameter, the boundary values of properties are evaluated and stored.
    This happens for properties which are appearing in the non-linear weights of
    advective fluxes in component mass and energy balance.

    **BC Values in the fractional flow setting**:

    If the user passed ``'use_fractional_flow_bc' == True`` as a model parameter,
    the non-linear weights in the advecitve fluxes are treated as *closed* expressions
    on the boundary. The user has to provide values for them explicitly and they are
    not computed using values of e.g. viscosity, density, enthalpies, saturations and
    partial fractions on the boundary.

    Important:

        This class resolves some inconsistencies in the parent methods regarding the BC
        type definition. There can be only one definition of Dirichlet and Neumann
        boundary for the fluxes based on Darcy's Law (advective fluxes), and is to be
        set in :meth:`bc_type_darcy_flux`. Other BC type definition for advective
        fluxes are overriden here and point to the BC type for the darcy flux.

        Due to how the Upwinding is implemented, it has its own BC type definition,
        **which must be flagged as Dirichlet everywhere**. Do not mess with
        :meth:`bc_type_advective_flux`. This inconsistency will be removed in the near
        future.

      of the system. If False, more work is required by the modeller.

      fraction of the reference component is eliminated by unity, reducing the number
      of unknowns. Also, the local mass constraint for the reference component is
      removed as an equation. If False, the modelled must close the system.
    - ``'normalize_state_constraints'``: Defaults to True. If True, local state
      constraints in the equilibrium problem are devided by the target value. Equations
      relating state functions become dimensionless.
    - ``'use_semismooth_complementarity'``: Defaults to True. If True, the
      complementarity conditions for each phase are formulated in semi-smooth form using
      a AD-compatible ``min`` operator. The semi-smooth Newton can be applied to solve
      the equilibrium problem. If False, the modeller must adapt the solution strategy.
    - ``'use_fractional_flow_bc'``: Defaults to False. If True, the model treats the
      non-linear weights in the advective fluxes in mass and energy balances as a closed
      term on the boundary. The user must then provide values for the non-linear weights
      directly. Otherwise, their values are calculated based on the values of inidivual
      terms they are composed of (e.g. density depending on pressure and temperature on
      the boundary).
    - ``'equilibrium_type'``: Defaults to None. If the model contains an equilibrium
      part, it should be a string indicating the fixed state of the local phase
      equilibrium problem e.g., ``'p-T'``,``'p-h'``. The string can also contain other
