"""Model mixins for multi-phase, multi-component flow, also denoted as compositional
flow (CF).

Provides means to formulate pressure equation, mass balance equations per component
and a total energy equation, using a fractional flow formulation with molar quantities.

Primary variables are pressure, specific fluid enthalpy and overall fractions,
as well as solute fractions for purely transpored solutes.

By default, the model is not closed, since saturations and temperature are dangling
variables.
The user needs to close models by providing a constitutive expression
for them and eliminating the variables by a local, algebraic equation.

class MobilityCF:
    """Mixin class defining mobilities for the balance equations in the CF setting, and
    which discretization is to be used for the magnitude of terms in the compositional
    flow and transport model.

    The flexibility is required due to the varying mathematical nature of the pressure
    equation, energy balance and transport equations.

    They also need all separate instances of the discretization objects to avoid
    false storage access.

    Discretizations handled by this class include those for the non-linear weights in
    various flux terms.

    Flux discretizations are handled by respective constitutive laws.

    Important:
        Mobility terms are designed to be representable also on boundary grids.
        **This is intended for the Dirichlet boundary where a value is required for e.g.
        upwinding.**

        Values on the Neumann boundary (especially fractional mobilities) must be
        implemented by the user in :class:`BoundaryConditionsCF`.
        Those values are then consequently multiplied with boundary flux values in
        respective balance equations.

        Since enthalpy is an independent variable, models using this balance need

    """Mixin treating boundary conditions for the compositional flow.

    Atop of inheriting the treatment for single phase flow (which is exploited for the
    total mass balance) and the energy balance (total energy balance), this class has
    a treatment for BC for fractional unknowns and phase properties as secondary
    expressions.

    **Essential BC**:

    In any case, the user must provide BC values for primary variables on the Dirichlet
    boundary. They are also used to compute values of phase properties on the boundary.

    On the Neumann boundary, the user must provide values for non-linear weights
    in various advective fluxes (fractional mobilities f.e.).

    **Other BC**:

    Since the modelling framework always introduces saturations and some relative
    fractions as independent variables, the user must also provide values for them
    on the Dirichlet BC.

    Important:

        This class resolves some inconsistencies in the parent methods regarding the bc
        type definition. There can be only one definition of Dirichlet and Neumann
        boundary for the fluxes based to Darcy's Law (advective fluxes), and is to be
        set in :meth:`bc_type_darcy_flux`. Other bce type definition for advective
        fluxes are overriden here and point to the bc type for the darcy flux.

        The Fourier flux can have Dirichlet type BC as well, but it is required that the
        Dirichlet faces of the darcy flux are contained in the Dirichlet faces for the
        Fourier flux, for consistency reasons.
        I.e., where Dirichlet pressure is given, Dirichlet temperature must be given.

        consistency.

        This method implements certain requirements to how the model is configured,
        aiming for complete mathematical consistency.

        Checks:

        1. Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin faces must be consistently defined for all advective
           fluxes.
        2. Dirichlet faces for the advective flux (where temperature must also be
           defined on the boundary to compute the advective weights), must be contained
           in the Dirichlet faces for the Fourier flux (important!)
        3. Fractional mobilities on boundaries must add up to 1 or be zero.
        4. Overall fractions on boundaries must add up to 1 or be zero.
        5. Pressure, temperature and overall fraction values on Dirichlet boundary must
           be strictly positive or zero on the same faces (boundary flash).

        While most of the checks are straight forward, check 2 needs an explanation:

        On Dirichlet faces for the Darcy flux, pressure must be provided, and a way
        to compute the weights in the advective flux.
        Since in the non-isothermal setting the fluid properties depend also on T,
        the user must provide T values there as well.

        Also, the conductive flux in the energy equation on this part of the boundary
        must hence not be given by Neumann conditions, but be consistent since T is
        provided.

        To summarize, on the boundary with pressure defined, temperature must be defined
        as well to compute the propertie. And since temperature is given, the Fourier
        flux cannot have Neumann values on those faces.

        Note though, that temperature can be defined on faces, where there are no
        Dirichlet conditions for pressure. This gives flexibility to define heated
        boundaries with no mass flux, in terms of both temperature and heat flux.
