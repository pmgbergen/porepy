"""Model mixins for multi-phase, multi-component flow, also denoted as compositional
flow (CF).

Provides means to formulate pressure equation, mass balance equations per component
and a total energy equation, using a fractional flow formulation with molar quantities.

Primary variables are pressure, specific fluid enthalpy and overall fractions,
as well as solute fractions for purely transpored solutes.

By default, the model is not closed, since saturations and temperature are dangling

The user needs to close models by providing a constitutive expression
for them and eliminating the variables by a local, algebraic equation.

    """Mixin treating boundary conditions for the compositional flow.

    Atop of inheriting the treatment for single phase flow (which is exploited for the
    total mass balance) and the energy balance (total energy balance), this class has
    a treatment for BC for fractional unknowns and phase properties as secondary
    expressions.

    **Essential BC**:

    In any case, the user must provide BC values for primary variables on the Dirichlet
    boundary. They are also used to compute values of phase properties on the boundary.

    On the Neumann boundary, the user must provide values for non-linear weights
    in various advective fluxes (fractional mobilities f.e.).

    **Other BC**:

    Since the modelling framework always introduces saturations and some relative
    fractions as independent variables, the user must also provide values for them
    on the Dirichlet BC.

    Important:

        This class resolves some inconsistencies in the parent methods regarding the bc
        type definition. There can be only one definition of Dirichlet and Neumann
        boundary for the fluxes based to Darcy's Law (advective fluxes), and is to be
        set in :meth:`bc_type_darcy_flux`. Other bce type definition for advective
        fluxes are overriden here and point to the bc type for the darcy flux.

        The Fourier flux can have Dirichlet type BC as well, but it is required that the
        Dirichlet faces of the darcy flux are contained in the Dirichlet faces for the
        Fourier flux, for consistency reasons.
        I.e., where Dirichlet pressure is given, Dirichlet temperature must be given.
