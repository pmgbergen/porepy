"""Model mixins for compositional flow (CF) and fractional flow (CFF).

Also serves as a basis for compositional flow with local equilibrium formulations
(CFLE).

The CF settings is general in terms of number of phases, number of components and
thermal conditions. It therefore does not contain a runnable model, but building blocks
for models concretized in terms of phases, components and thermal setting.

The following equations are available:

- :class:`ComponentMassBalanceEquations`: While the :class:`~porepy.models.
  fluid_mass_balance.TotalMassBalanceEquations` represent the balance of total mass
  (pressure equation), this equation represent the balance equation of individual
  components in the fluid mixture. Interface fluxes are handled using the overall
  Darcy interface flux implemented in the pressure equations and an adapted non-linear
  term. It introduces a single equation, all interface equations are introduced by
  :class:`~porepy.models.fluid_mass_balance.TotalMassBalanceEquations`. Interface fluxes
  for individual components are computed using the total interface flux and a
  corresponding weight. As of now, the component mass balance equations are purely
  advective.
- :class:`DiffusiveTotalMassBalanceEquations`: A diffusive variant of the total mass
  balance, where the total mobility is an isotropic contribution to the permeability
  tensor. To be used in a fractional flow model. This model is computationally
  expensive, since it requires a re-discretization of the MPFA, but also numerically
  consistent.
- :class:`TwoVariableTotalEnergyBalanceEquations`: A specialized total energy balance
  using an independent (specific fluid) enthalpy variable in the accumulation term.
  Otherwise completely analogous to its base
  :class:`~porepy.models.energy_balance.TotalEnergyBalanceEquations`.

The primary equations include a total mass balance, component balance and the energy
balance equation. A collection for non-isothermal, non-diffusive flow is given in
:class:`PrimaryEquationsCF`.

The primary variables are assumed to be a single pressure (no capillarity), an enthalpy
or temperature variable, and overall fraction variables. They are collected in
:class:`VariablesCF`.

Considering solely the flow formulation without constitutive modelling, where phase
properties are given by :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.surrogate_operator.SurrogateFactory`
, special IC and BC classes handling the consistent update are given by
:class:`InitialConditionsPhaseProperties` and :class:`BoundaryConditionsPhaseProperties`
respectively. They handle the automatized computation of respective values during the
simulation.

The following IC mixins are available:

- :class:`InitialConditionsFractions`: Provides an interface to set initial conditions
  for overall fractions and active tracer fractions, if any. Other fractions are for now
  not covered since they are considered secondary and their initialization can be done
  based on the primary fractions.
- :class:`InitialConditionsPhaseProperties`: An initialization routine for models where
  phase properties are represented by :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.surrogate_operator.
  SurrogateFactory`. Their initialization is dependent on variable values, and is
  automatized to happen after the variables are initialized.
- :class:`InitialConditionsCF`: A collection of above initialization
  routines, and the IC mixins for mass & energy, including an independent enthalpy
  variable.

The following BC mixins are available:

- :class:`BoundaryConditionsMulticomponent`: The analogy to
  :class:`InitialConditionsFractions` but for BC.
- :class:'BoundaryConditionsPhaseProperties': The analogy to
  :class:`InitialConditionsPhaseProperties` but for BC. Their update can be automatized
  to happen after values for variables are set on the boundary.
- :class:`BoundaryConditionsFractionalFlow`: An alternative to
  :class:`BoundaryConditionsPhaseProperties` for the fractional flow setting, where
  various non-linear terms in fluxes can be given explicitly on the boundary,
  instead of providing variable values which in return compute phase properties
  appearing in those expressions.
- :class:`BoundaryConditionsCF`: A collection of BC update routines for
  primary variables and phase properties as surrogate factories, including those from
  mass & energy, enthalpy and fractions.
- :class:`BoundaryConditionsCFF`: The alternative to
  :class:`BoundaryConditionsCF` for the fractional flow setting with
  explicit values for non-linear weights in fluxes.

The following solution strategy mixins are available:

- :class:`SolutionStrategyPhaseProperties`: A mixed in strategy for evaluating and
  storing fluid phase properties based on the underlying EoS and using the surrogate
  operator framework. This is a proper mixin, meaning it is not inheriting from any
  solution strategy and must be used together with some solution strategy for equations.
- :class:`SolutionStrategyNonlinearMPFA`: A mixed in strategy for re-discretizing MPFA
  discretizations of the Darcy and Fourier flux. It is also a proper mixin, to be used
  in combination with some other, fully functional solution strategy.
- :class:`SolutionStrategyCF`: Combining the solution strategy for updating phase
  properties, with the strategy for fluid mass and energy balance.
- :class:`SolutionStrategyCFF`: Like the previous strategy but with
  :class:`SolutionStrategyNonlinearMPFA` as an additional base.

The two setups, :class:`CompositionalFlowSetup` and
:class:`CompositionalFractionalFlowSetup` are skeletons for non-isothermal, multiphase,
multicomponent flow & transport models. They do not contain the constitutive modelling
of fluid properties though and are hence not runable.
The steps required by users to close the setups and obtain runable models are:

1. Define a fluid with all its phases and components.
2. Close the system with local equations for dangling, fractional variables. These can
   either be :class:`~porepy.models.abstract_equations.LocalElimination` using some
   map or third-party correlations, or a closure in form of a local equilibrium system.

    Since feed fractions per independent component are unknowns, the model requires

    This equation is defined on all subdomains. Due to a single pressure and interface
    flux variable, there is no need for additional equations as is the case in the
    pressure equation. The interface flux for individual components is computed using
    the total interface flux provided by the pressure equation, a respective weight and
    upwind-coupling discretization.

    Important:
        The component mass balance equations expect the total mass balance (pressure
        equation) to be part of the system. That equation defines interface fluxes
        between subdomains, which are used by the present class to advect components.
