""""Module containing some constant heuristic fluid property implementations and
the mixin :class:`FluidMobility`, which is required in all flow & transport problems.

Most of the laws implemented here are meant for 1-phase, 1-component mixtures, using
some fluid component stored in the fluid's reference component and have an analytical
expression which can be handled by PorePy's AD framework.

Note:
    In order to override default implementations of fluid properties in
    :class:`~porepy.compositional.compositional_mixins.FluidMixin`, the classes hererin
    must be mixed into the model *before* the fluid mixin.

            FluidMixin,
