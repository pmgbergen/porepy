""" Contains the mother class for all models, that is, standardized setups for complex
problems.

Some methods may raise NotImplementedErrors instead of being abstract methods. This
is because they are only needed for some model types (typically nonlinear ones).

Note on running simulations: We provide run_time_dependent_model and run_stationary_model.
Both call the Model's prepare_simulation and after_simulation methods, as well as the
solve method of either a LinearSolver or NewtonSolver (the only non-linear solver available
for the time being). The Solvers call methods before_newton_loop, check_convergence,
after_newton_convergence/after_newton_divergence, (only NewtonSolver:) before_newton_iteration,
after_newton_iteration. The name "newton" is there for legacy reasons, a more fitting
and general name would be something like "equation_solve".
