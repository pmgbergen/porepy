r"""Coupling of mass and momentum balance to obtain poromechanics equations.

The module only contains what is needed for the coupling, the two individual subproblems
are defined elsewhere.

The main changes to the equations are achieved by changing the constitutive laws for
porosity and stress. The former aquires a pressure dependency and an additional
:math:`\alpha`\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} term, while the latter is modified to include a
isotropic pressure term :math:`\alpha p \mathbf{I}`.
