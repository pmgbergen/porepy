Class types:
    - MomentumBalanceEquations defines subdomain and interface equations through the
    terms entering. Momentum balance between opposing fracture interfaces is imposed.

Notes:
    - The class MomentumBalanceEquations is a mixin class, and should be inherited by a
      class that defines the variables and discretization.

    - Refactoring needed for constitutive equations. Modularisation and moving to the
      library.
