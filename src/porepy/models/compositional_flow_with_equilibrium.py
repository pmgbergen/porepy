"""Extensions of model mixins for compositional flow (CF) to acount for local
equilibrium (LE) equations and and the usage of a flash instance.

The most important difference is, that in this fully, thermodynamically consistent
formulation of the compositional flow problem, there are no dangling variables.
No separate constitutive modelling is required because thermodynamic properties and
secondary variables are fully determined by the result of the local equilibrium problem.

Also, equilibrium calculations (in the unified setting) introduce extended fractions.
Partial fractions become dependent operators (normalization of extended fractions).

Provides a fully formulated CF model with local equilibrium equations formulated as
a p-h flash.

    """A solution strategy for compositional flow with local equilibrium conditions in
    the unified setting.

    Updates of secondary variables and expressions (thermodynamic properties) are
    performed using the provided flash instance.

    Note:
        CFLE models have extended fractions (as per unified flash assumptions).
        Partial fractions are dependent operators.

    Important:
        Compositional flow models with local equilibrium equations assume that the
        model is closed in the sense that secondary variables are completely determined
        by the local equilibrium equations.

        Hence no secondary variable (as defined by the base variable mixin for CF) is
        eliminated by some constitutive expression.

    New model parameters introduced for instantiation:

    - ``'has_time_dependent_boundary_equilibrium'``: Defaults to False.
      A bool indicating whether Dirichlet BC for pressure, temperature or
      feed fractions are time-dependent.

      If True, the boundary equilibrium will be re-computed at the beginning of every
      time step. This is required to provide e.g., values of the advective weights on
      the boundary for upwinding.

      Cannot be True if :attr:`SolutionStrategyCFLE.equilibrium_type` is set to None
      (and hence no flash method was introduced).
