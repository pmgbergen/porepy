    """Determine if the vertices of a polygon are sorted counterclockwise.

    The method computes the winding number of the polygon, see below references.

    The algorithm should work for non-convex polygons. If the polygon is
    self-intersecting (e.g. shaped like the number 8), the number returned will reflect
    whether the method is 'mostly' cw or ccw.

    Note:
        The test can *not* be used to determine whether the vertexes of a polygon are
        ordered in a natural fashion, that is, not self-intersecting.

    Examples:

        >>> is_ccw_polygon(np.array([[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]))
        True
        >>> is_ccw_polygon(np.array([[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]))

    The line segment going from ``p1`` to ``p2`` is tested vs. a third point to
