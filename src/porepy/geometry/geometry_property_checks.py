def is_ccw_polygon(poly: np.ndarray) -> bool:
    """
    Determine if the vertices of a polygon are sorted counter clockwise.

    The method computes the winding number of the polygon, see
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1165647/how-to-determine-if-a-list-of-polygon-points-are-in-clockwise-order
    and
        http://blog.element84.com/polygon-winding.html

    for descriptions of the algorithm.

    The algorithm should work for non-convex polygons. If the polygon is
    self-intersecting (e.g. shaped like the number 8), the number returned will
    reflect whether the method is 'mostly' cw or ccw.

    NOTE: The test can *not* be used to determine whether the vertexes of a polygon are
    ordered in a natural fashion, that is, not self-intersecting.

    Parameters:
        poly (np.ndarray, 2xn): Polygon vertices.

    Returns:
        boolean, True if the polygon is ccw.

    See also:
        is_ccw_polyline

    Examples:
        >>> is_ccw_polygon(np.array([[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]))
        True

        >>> is_ccw_polygon(np.array([[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]))

    The function is intended for 2D points; higher-dimensional coordinates will

    Parameters:
        p1 (np.ndarray, length 2): Point on dividing line
        p2 (np.ndarray, length 2): Point on dividing line
        p3 (np.ndarray): Points to be tested
        tol (double, optional): Tolerance used in the comparison, can be used

            tolerance. Should be set according to what is desired behavior of
            the function (will vary with application). Defaults to False.

    Returns:

    on github (no pypi or similar), and we are also not aware of other
    implementations of algorithms for point-in-polyhedron problems that allows
    for non-convex polyhedra. Moreover, the file above has an unclear licence.

    in the PYTHONPATH with the name 'robust_point_in_polyhedron.py'

    Suggestions for better solutions to this are most welcome.

    Parameters:
