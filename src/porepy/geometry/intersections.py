    """
    Check if two line segments defined by their start end endpoints, intersect.

    The lines are assumed to be in 2D.

    Note that, oposed to other functions related to grid generation such as
    remove_edge_crossings, this function does not use the concept of
    snap_to_grid. This may cause problems at some point, although no issues
    have been discovered so far.

    Implementation note:
        This function can be replaced by a call to segments_3d. Todo.

    Example:
        >>> lines_intersect([0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1], [1, 0])
        array([[ 0.5],
           [ 0.5]])

        >>> lines_intersect([0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1])

    Parameters:
        start_1 (np.ndarray or list): coordinates of start point for first
            line.
        end_1 (np.ndarray or list): coordinates of end point for first line.
        start_2 (np.ndarray or list): coordinates of start point for first
            line.
        end_2 (np.ndarray or list): coordinates of end point for first line.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray (2 x num_pts): coordinates of intersection point, or the
            endpoints of the intersection segments if relevant. In the case of
            a segment, the first point (column) will be closest to start_1.  If
            the lines do not intersect, None is returned.

def polygons_3d(polys, target_poly=None, tol=1e-8):
    """ Compute the intersection between polygons embedded in 3d.

    In addition to intersection points, the function also decides:
        1) Whether intersection points lie in the interior, on a segment or a vertex.
           If segment or vertex, the index of the segment or vertex is returned.
        2) Whether a pair of intersection points lie on the same boundary segment of a
           polygon, that is, if the polygon has a T or L-type intersection with another
           paolygon.

    Assumptions:
        * All polygons are convex. Non-convex polygons will simply be treated
          in a wrong way.
        * No polygon contains three points on a line, that is, an angle of pi. This can
            be included, possibly by temporarily stripping the hanging node from the
            polygon definition.
        * If two polygons meet in a vertex, this is not considered an intersection.
        * If two polygons lie in the same plane, intersection types (vertex, segment,
            interior) are not classified. This will be clear from the returned values.
            Inclusion of this should be possible, but it has not been a priority.
        * Contact between polygons in a single point may not be accurately calculated.

    Parameters:
        polys (list of np.array): Each list item represents a polygon, specified
            by its vertexses as a numpy array, of dimension 3 x num_pts. There
            should be at least three vertexes in the polygon.
        target_poly (int or np.array, optional): Index in poly of the polygons that
            should be target for intersection findings. These will be compared with the
            whole set in poly. If not provided, all polygons are compared with
            each other.
        tol (double, optional): Geometric tolerance for the computations.

    Returns:
        np.array: 3 x num_pt, intersection coordinates.
        np.array of lists: For each of the polygons, give the index of the intersection
            points, referring to the columns of the intersection coordinates.
        np.array of list: For each polygon, a list telling whether each of the intersections
            is on the boundary of the polygon or not. For polygon i, the first
            element in this list tells whether the point formed by point-indices
            0 and 1 in the previous return argument is on the boundary.
        list of tuples: Each list element is a 2-tuple with the indices of
            intersecting polygons.
        list of list of tuples: For each polygon, for all intersection points (same
            order as the second return value), a 2-tuple, where the first value
            gives an index, the second is a Boolean, True if the intersection is on a
            segment, False if vertex. The index identifies the vertex, or the first
            vertex of the segment. If the intersection is in the interior of a polygon,
            the tuple is replaced by an empty list.
