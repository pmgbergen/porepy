    r"""Check if two line segments, defined by their start- and endpoints, intersect.

    The lines are assumed to be in 2D.

    If the lines are (almost) parallel, i.e. if

    .. math::
        \begin{vmatrix}
            start_1 & end_1 \\

    a line segment is returned instead of an intersection point.

    Todo:
        This function can be replaced by a call to :meth:`segments_3d`.

    Example:
        >>> segments_2d([0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1], [1, 0])
        array([[ 0.5],
               [ 0.5]])

        array([[0., 1.],
               [0., 1.]])

        >>> segments_2d([0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]) is None
        True

    Parameters:
        start_1: ``shape=(2,)``
        
            Coordinates of start point for first line.
        end_1: ``shape=(2,)``

            Tolerance for detecting parallel lines.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the start and endpoints of a line are the same.

    Returns:
        Coordinates of intersection point, or the endpoints of the intersection segments
        if relevant. In the case of a segment, the first point (column) will be closest
        to ``start_1``. Shape is ``(2, np)``, where ``np`` is ``1`` for a point
        intersection, or ``2`` for a segment intersection. If the lines do not
        intersect, ``None`` is returned.

    In addition to intersection points, the function also decides:

        1) Whether intersection points lie in the interior, on a segment or a vertex.
           If segment or vertex, the index of the segment or vertex is returned.
        2) Whether a pair of intersection points lie on the same boundary segment of a
           polygon, that is, if the polygon has a T or L-type intersection with another
           polygon.

    Assumptions:

        - All polygons are convex. Non-convex polygons will simply be treated in a wrong
          way. To circumvent this, split the non-convex polygon into convex parts.
        - No polygon contains three points on a line, that is, an angle of pi. This can
          be included, possibly by temporarily stripping the hanging node from the
          polygon definition.
        - If two polygons meet in a vertex, this is not considered an intersection.
        - If two polygons lie in the same plane, intersection types (vertex, segment,
          interior) are not classified. This will be clear from the returned values.
          Inclusion of this should be possible, but it has not been a priority.
        - Contact between polygons in a single point may not be accurately calculated.

    Parameters:
        polys: ``shape=(3, np)``

            Each list item represents a polygon, specified by its
            vertices as a numpy array. There should be at least three vertices in the
            polygon.
        target_poly: ``default=None``

            Index in poly of the polygons that should be targeted for
            intersection findings. These will be compared with the whole set in poly.

            If not provided, all polygons are compared with each other.
        tol: ``default=1e-8``

            Geometric tolerance for the computations.
        include_point_contact: ``default=True``

            If True, point contacts will be considered an
            intersection. This is an experimental feature, use with care.

    Returns:
        Returns a tuple consisting of:

        :obj:`~numpy.ndarray`: ``shape=(3, np)``

            Intersection coordinates.
        :obj:`~numpy.ndarray`:
            For each of the polygons, give the index of the intersection points,
            referring to the columns of the intersection coordinates.
        :obj:`~numpy.ndarray`:
            For each polygon, a list telling whether each of the intersections is on the
            boundary of the polygon or not. For polygon ``i``, the first element in this
            list tells whether the point formed by point-indices ``0`` and ``1`` in the
            previous return argument is on the boundary.
        :obj:`list`:
            Each list element is a 2-tuple with the indices of intersecting polygons.
        :obj:`~numpy.ndarray`:
            For each polygon, for all intersection points (same order as the second
            return value), a 2-tuple, where the first value gives an index, the second
            is a Boolean, ``True`` if the intersection is on a segment, ``False`` if
            vertex. The index identifies the vertex, or the first vertex of the segment.
            If the intersection is in the interior of a polygon, the tuple is replaced
            by an empty list.
        :obj:`~numpy.ndarray`:
            For each polygon, for all intersection points, ``True`` if this intersection
            is formed by a single point.

    The connections are defined by their start and endpoints, and can also have tags
    assigned. If so, the tags are preserved as connections are split. The connections
    are uniquified, so that no combination of point indices occurs more than once.

    Note:
        For (partly) overlapping segments, only one of the tags will survive the
        uniquification. The other can be reconstructed by using the third output.

    Parameters:

            Coordinates of points to be processed.
        e: ``shape=(n, n_con)``
