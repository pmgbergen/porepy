    The implementation is based on the reference: Robust inside-outside segmentation

    Implementation requires consistent orientation of the triangulated surface.

    Parameters:

        connectivity (shape=(num_triangles, 3)): Triangulation connectivity map.
        tol (optional): Geometric tolerance, used in comparison of points, areas and
            volumes. Defaults to 1e-10.
