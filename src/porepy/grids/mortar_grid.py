class MortarGrid:
    """Parent class for mortar grids.

    It contains two grids representing the left and right part of the mortar grid and
    the weighted mapping from the primary grid to the mortar grids and from the
    secondary grid to the mortar grids. The two mortar grids can be different. The
    primary grid is assumed to be one dimension higher than the mortar grids, while the
    secondary grid can either one dimension higher or the same dimension as the mortar
    grids.

    .. note::
        The mortar class is mostly tested for the case when the secondary grid has the
        same dimension as the mortar grid. Especially, the updating of any grid should
        not be expected to work and will most likely throw an error.

    Parameters:
        dim: Grid dimension.
        side_grids: Grid on each side.
        primary_secondary: Cell-face relations between the higher dimensional grid and
            the lower dimensional grid. It is possible to not give the projection to
            create only the grid.
        codim: Dimension difference between the primary grid secondary grid.
        name: Name of the grid. Can also be used to set various information on the grid.
        face_duplicate_ind (optional): Which faces should be considered duplicates, and
            mapped to the second of the side_grids. If not provided, duplicate faces
            will be inferred from the indices of the faces. Will only be used if
            ``len(side_Grids) == 2``.
        tol (optional): Tolerance used in geometric computations. Defaults to ``1e-6``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``dim==3``. The mortar grid can not be three-dimensional.
        ValueError: If the mortar grids have different dimensions.
        ValueError: If the number of sides is not 1 or 2.
        ValueError: If ``face_duplicate_ind`` is not ``None`` and the co-dimension is 2.
            In this case there are no faces to duplicate.
