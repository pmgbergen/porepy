    """ Obtain mappings between the cells of non-matching 1d grids.

    The function constructs an refined 1d grid that consists of all nodes
    of at least one of the input grids.

    It is asumed that the two grids are aligned, with common start and
    endpoints.

    Implementation note: It should be possible to avoid old_1d, by extracting
    points from a 2D grid that lie along the line defined by g_1d.
    However, if g_2d is split along a fracture, the nodes will be
    duplicated. We should then return two grids, probably based on the
    coordinates of the cell centers. sounds cool.

    Parameters:
         new_1d (grid): First grid to be matched
         old_1d (grid): Second grid to be matched.
         tol (double): Tolerance used to filter away false overlaps caused by

        Column major sparse matrix mapping from coarse to fine cells.


    This method creates a mapping from fine to coarse cells by creating a matrix 'M'
    where the rows represent the fine cells while the columns represent the coarse
    cells. In practice this means that for an array 'p', of known values on a coarse
    grid, by applying the mapping
        q = M * p
    each value in a coarse cell will now be transferred to all the fine cells contained
    within the coarse cell.

    The procedure for creating this mapping relies on two main assumptions.
        1. Each fine cell is fully contained inside exactly one coarse cell.
        2. Each cell can be characterised as a simplex.
            - i.e. Every node except one defines every face of the object.

    The first assumption implies that the problem of assessing if a fine cell is
    contained within a coarse cell is reduced to assessing if the center of a fine cell
    is contained within the coarse cell.
    
    The second assumption implies that a cell in any dimension (1D, 2D, 3D) will be a
    convex object. This way, we can use existing algorithms in PorePy to find if a point
    is inside a polygon (2D) or polyhedron (3D). (The 1D case is trivial)

    The general algorithm is as follows (refer to start of for-loop in the code):
    1. Make a list of (pointers to) untested cell centers called 'test_cells_ptr'.
    2. Iterate through all coarse cells. Now, consider one of these:
    3. For all untested cell centers (defined by 'test_cells_ptr'), check if they are
        inside the coarse cell.
    4. Those that pass (is inside the coarse cell) add to the mapping, then remove those
        point from the list of untested cell centers.
    5. Assemble the mapping.
