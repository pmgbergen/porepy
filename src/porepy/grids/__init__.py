"""The subpackage ``grids`` contains classes und functions necessary to create a
geometrical representation of a (mixed-dimensional) domain.

Next to the base classes representing single grids and mortar grids, implementations
for structured and unstructured grids are provided. A key component is the
mixed-dimensional grid, which is used to represent domains with fractures and fracture
intersections.

Finally, this subpackage also contains functionality to coarsen, refine and partition a
grid, among other.
