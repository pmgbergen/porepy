        Initialize an elliptic shaped fracture, approximated by a polygon.


        The rotation of the plane is calculated using three angles. First, the
        rotation of the major axis from the x-axis. Next, the fracture is
        inclined by specifying the strike angle (which gives the rotation
        axis) measured from the x-axis, and the dip angle. All angles are
        measured in radians.

        Parameters:
            center (np.ndarray, size 3x1): Center coordinates of fracture.
            major_axis (double): Length of major axis (radius-like, not
                diameter).

                whether the minor axis is less or equal the major.
            major_axis_angle (double, radians): Rotation of the major axis from
                the x-axis. Measured before strike-dip rotation, see above.
            strike_angle (double, radians): Line of rotation for the dip.
                Given as angle from the x-direction.
            dip_angle (double, radians): Dip angle, i.e. rotation around the
                strike direction.
            num_points (int, optional): Number of points used to approximate
                the ellipsis. Defaults to 16.

        Split the fracture surfaces into non-intersecting polygons.

        Starting from a description of the fracture polygons and their
        intersection lines (which should be non-intersecting), the fractures
        are split into sub-polygons which they may share a boundary, but no
        sub-polygon intersect the surface of another. This step is necessary
        for the fracture network to be ammenable to gmsh.

        The sub-polygons are defined by drawing auxiliary lines between
        fracture points. This expands the global set of edges, but not the
        points. The auxiliary lines will be sent to gmsh as constraints on the
        gridding algorithm.

        TODO: The restriction that the auxiliary lines can only be drawn
        between existing lines can create unfortunate constraints in the
        gridding, in terms of sharp angles etc. This can be alleviated by
        adding additional points to the global description. However, if a point
        is added to an intersection edge, this will require an update of all
        fractures sharing that intersection. Not sure what the right thing to
        do here is.

        Parameters:
            all_p (np.ndarray, 3xn): Coordinates of all points used to describe
                the fracture polygons, and their intersections. Should be
                unique.
            edges (np.ndarray, 2xn): Connections between points, formed either
                by a fracture boundary, or a fracture intersection.
            edges_2_frac (list): For each edge, index of all fractures that
                point to the edge.
            is_boundary_edge (np.ndarray of bool, size=num_edges): A flag
                telling whether the edge is on the boundary of a fracture.

        Returns:
            np.ndarray (3xn_pt): Coordinates of all points used to describe the
                fractures.
            np.ndarray (3xn_edges): Connections between points, formed by
                fracture boundaries, fracture intersections, or auxiliary lines
                needed to form sub-polygons. The auxiliary lines will be added
                towards the end of the array.
            np.ndarray (boolean, 3xn_edges_orig): Flag telling if an edge is on
                the boundary of a fracture. NOTE: The list is *not* expanded as
                auxiliary lines are added; these are known to not be on the
                boundary. The legth of this output, relative to the second, can
                thus be used to flag auxiliary lines.
            list of np.ndarray: Each item contains a sub-polygon, specified by
                the global indices of its vertices.
            list of int: For each sub-polygon, index of the fracture it forms a
                part of.

            Note that for the moment, the first and third outputs are not
            modified compared to respective input. This will change if the
            splitting is allowed to introduce new additional points.
