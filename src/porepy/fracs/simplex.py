def triangle_grid_embedded(file_name):
    """ Create triangular (2D) grid of a domain embedded in 3D space, without
    meshing the 3D volume.

    The resulting grid can be used in a DFN model. The grid will be fully
    conforming along intersections between fractures.

    This function produces a set of grids for fractures and lower-dimensional
    objects, but it does nothing to merge the grids. To create a GridBucket,
    use the function fracs.meshing.dfn instead, with the option
    conforming=True.

    To set the mesh size, use parameters mesh_size_frac and mesh_size_min, to represent the
    ideal and minimal mesh size sent to gmsh. For more details, see the gmsh
    manual on how to set mesh sizes.

    Parameters:
        file_name (str, optional): Filename for communication with gmsh.
            The config file for gmsh will be f_name.geo, with the grid output
            to f_name.msh. Defaults to dfn_network.

    Returns:
        list (length 3): For each dimension (2 -> 0), a list of all grids in
            that dimension.
