def tetrahedral_grid(fracs=None, box=None, network=None, subdomains=[], **kwargs):
    """
    Create grids for a domain with possibly intersecting fractures in 3d.
    The function can be call through the wrapper function meshing.simplex_grid.

    Based on the specified fractures, the method computes fracture
    intersections if necessary, creates a gmsh input file, runs gmsh and reads
    the result, and then constructs grids in 3d (the whole domain), 2d (one for
    each individual fracture), 1d (along fracture intersections), and 0d
    (meeting between intersections).

    The fractures can be specified is terms of the keyword 'fracs' (either as
    numpy arrays or Fractures, see below), or as a ready-made FractureNetwork
    by the keyword 'network'. For fracs, the boundary of the domain must be
    specified as well, by 'box'. For a ready network, the boundary will be
    imposed if provided. For a network will use pre-computed intersection and
    decomposition if these are available (attributes 'intersections' and
    'decomposition').

    Parameters
    ----------
    fracs (list, optional): List of either pre-defined fractures, or
        np.ndarrays, (each 3xn) of fracture vertexes.
    box (dictionary, optional). Domain specification. Should have keywords
        xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax.
    network (fractures.FractureNetwork, optional): A FractureNetwork
        containing fractures.
    subdomain (list, optional): List of planes partitioning the 3d domain
        into subdomains. The planes are defined in the same way as fracs.

    The fractures should be specified either by a combination of fracs and
    box, or by network (possibly combined with box). See above.

    **kwargs: To be explored.

    Returns
    -------
    list (length 4): For each dimension (3 -> 0), a list of all grids in
        that dimension.

    --------

    The resulting grid can be used in a DFN model. The grid will be fully

    This function produces a set of grids for fractures and lower-dimensional
    objects, but it does nothing to merge the grids. To create a GridBucket,
    use the function fracs.meshing.dfn instead, with the option
    conforming=True.

    To set the mesh size, use parameters mesh_size_frac and mesh_size_min, to represent the
    ideal and minimal mesh size sent to gmsh. For more details, see the gmsh
    manual on how to set mesh sizes.

    Parameters:
        network (FractureNetwork): To be meshed.
        find_isect (boolean, optional): If True (default), the network will
            search for intersections among fractures. Set False if
            network.find_intersections() already has been called.
        f_name (str, optional): Filename for communication with gmsh.
            The config file for gmsh will be f_name.geo, with the grid output
            to f_name.msh. Defaults to dfn_network.
        mesh_size_frac (double, optional): Target mesh size sent to gmsh. If not
            provided, gmsh will do its best to decide on the mesh size.
        mesh_size_min (double, optional): Minimal mesh size sent to gmsh. If not

    Parameters
    ----------
    fracs: (dictionary) Two fields: points (2 x num_points) np.ndarray,

    subdomains (dict, optional): If given, the grid is constrained to these segments
