        has_checked_intersections (boolean): If True, the intersection finder
            method has been run. Useful in meshing algorithms to avoid
            recomputing known information.
        tol (double): Geometric tolerance used in computations.
        domain (dictionary): External bounding box. See
            impose_external_boundary() for details.

        decomposition (dictionary): Splitting of network, accounting for

        Set an external boundary for the fracture set.

        There are two permissible data formats for the domain boundary:
            1) A 3D box, described by its minimum and maximum coordinates.
            2) A list of polygons (each specified as a np.array, 3xn), that together

        If desired, the fratures will be truncated to lay within the bounding
        box; that is, Fracture.p will be modified. The orginal coordinates of
        the fracture boundary can still be recovered from the attribute
        Fracture.orig_points.

        Fractures that are completely outside the bounding box will be deleted
        from the fracture set.

        Parameters:
            box (dictionary): Has fields 'xmin', 'xmax', and similar for y and

            truncate_fractures (boolean, optional): If True, fractures outside

        size parameters.

        The function should only be called once to avoid insertion of multiple
        layers of extra points, this will likely kill gmsh.

        The function is motivated by similar functionality for 2d domains, but
        is considerably less mature.

        The function should be used in conjunction with _determine_mesh_size().
        The ultimate goal is to set the mesh size
        for geometrical points in Gmsh. To that end, this function inserts
        additional points on the fracture boundaries. The mesh size is then
        determined as the distance between all points in the fracture
        description.

        Parameters:
            mesh_size_frac: Ideal mesh size. Will be added to all points that
                are sufficiently far away from other points.
            mesh_size_min: Minimal mesh size; we will make no attempts to
                enforce even smaller mesh sizes upon Gmsh.
            mesh_size_bound (optional): Boundary mesh size. Will be added to the points
                defining the boundary, unless there are any fractures in the
                immediate vicinity influencing the size. In other words,
                mesh_size_bound is the boundary point equivalent of
