        intersections. In the simplest case, the well is a (poly)line with two
        end points, and a single grid is produced.
        Intersection grids are added for all intersection points between wells
        and fractures. Finally, edges are added between intersection points and
        both fractures and well segments.
        Example topology for well intersecting two fractures, terminating at the
        lowermost:

                     |

        sd_isec_1    . * e(sd_isec_1, sd_frac_1)  ____________ sd_frac_1 (2d)

        Note that all edge grids (*) are zero-dimensional, and that those
        connected with the fracture have co-dimension 2!

        Each point defining the well polyline is assumed to have a tag list
        stored in w.tags["intersecting_fractures"]. An empty tag means the point
        does not correspond to a fracture intersection. An integer entry i
        identifies an intersection with the fracture with g.frac_num = i.
        If the list contains multiple tags, the interpretation would be an
        intersection between the well and a fracture intersection line or point.
        This is not implemented. Points not corresponding to a fracture
        intersection, but merely representing a kink in the polyline, will
        not be represented by a 0d grid. Rather, the two neighbouring segments
        are joined and a single _piecewise_ linear grid is produced.

        This function may be split/restructured in the future. One possibility
        is to let gmsh do the actual meshing as done in the FractureNetwork
