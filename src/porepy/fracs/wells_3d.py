        end points, and a single grid is produced.
        Intersection grids are added for all intersection points between wells
        and fractures. Finally, edges are added between intersection points and

        Note that all edge grids (*) are zero-dimensional, and that those
        connected with the fracture have co-dimension 2!

        Each point defining the well polyline is assumed to have a tag list
        stored in w.tags["intersecting_fractures"]. An empty tag means the point
        does not correspond to a fracture intersection. An integer entry i
        identifies an intersection with the fracture with g.frac_num = i.
        If the list contains multiple tags, the interpretation would be an
        intersection between the well and a fracture intersection line or point.
        This is not implemented. Points not corresponding to a fracture
        intersection, but merely representing a kink in the polyline, will
        not be represented by a 0d grid. Rather, the two neighbouring segments
        are joined and a single _piecewise_ linear grid is produced.

        This function may be split/restructured in the future. One possibility
        is to let gmsh do the actual meshing as done in the FractureNetwork
        classes. For now, this simplified approach is deemed sufficient.
