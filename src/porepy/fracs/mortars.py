"""
Intended workflow for mortars:
    1) Create a full grid bucket of all objects to be included.
    2) Somehow create new grids for (some of) the nodes in the bucket.
    3) Find relation between new grid and neighboring grids.
    4) Replace nodes in the bucket
    5) Replace projection operators located on grid_bucket edges.

Implementation needs:
    1) Initialize identity (whatever that means) projections when a grid
       bucket is created.
    2) Create a framework for modifying grids. In the first stage this will
       involve perturbing nodes (not on the boundary). Second stage shoud be
       refinements of simplex grids. Partial remeshing with other parameters
       should also be on the list.
       -> Partly solved by grids.refinement.
    3) Methods to match cells and faces from different grids.
       -> First attempt in relate_1d_and_2d_grids()
    4) Creation of general projection matrices. Closely related to
    5) Numerical methods that can handle general projections.
