class Fracture(abc.ABC):
    """Abstract base class for representing a single fracture.

    This base class provides general functionalities agnostic to the dimension of
    the fracture and the ambient dimension. It contains various utility methods,
    mainly intended for the use together with the FractureNetwork class.

    A fracture is defined by its `npt` vertices, stored in an `nd x npt` numpy-array,
    where `nd` is the assumed ambient dimension. The order/sorting of vertices has to be
    implemented explicitly.

    Dimension-dependent routines are implemented as abstract methods.

    PorePy currently only supports planar and convex fractures fully. As a work-around,
    the fracture can be split into convex parts.

    Attributes:
        points (ArrayLike): Fracture vertices, stored in the implemented order.
            Shape is (nd, npt).
        orig_pts (np.ndarray): Original fracture vertices.
            Shape is (nd, npt)
            The original points are kept in case the fracture geometry is modified.
        center (np.ndarray): Fracture centroid.
            Shape is (nd, ).
        normal (np.ndarray): Normal vector.
            Shape is (nd, ).
        index (int): Index of fracture.
            Intended use in FractureNetwork. Exact use is not clear (several fractures can
            be given same index), use it with care.
