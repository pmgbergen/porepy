def simplex_grid(fracs, domain, **kwargs):
    """
    Main function for grid generation. Creates a fractured simiplex grid in 2
    or 3 dimensions.

    NOTE: For some fracture networks, what appears to be a bug in Gmsh leads to
    surface grids with cells that does not have a corresponding face in the 3d
    grid. The problem may have been resolved (at least partly) by newer
    versions of Gmsh, but can still be an issue for our purposes. If this
    behavior is detected, an assertion error is raised. To avoid the issue,
    and go on with a surface mesh that likely is problematic, kwargs should
    contain a keyword ensure_matching_face_cell=False.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fracs (list of np.ndarray): One list item for each fracture. Each item
        consist of a (nd x n) array describing fracture vertices. The
        fractures may be intersecting.
    domain (dict): Domain specification, determined by xmin, xmax, ...
    **kwargs: May contain fracture tags, options for gridding, etc.

    Returns
    -------
    GridBucket: A complete bucket where all fractures are represented as
        lower dim grids. The higher dim fracture faces are split in two,
        and on the edges of the GridBucket graph the mapping from lower dim
        cells to higher dim faces are stored as 'face_cells'. Each face is
        given a FaceTag depending on the type:
           NONE: None of the below (i.e. an internal face)
           DOMAIN_BOUNDARY: All faces that lie on the domain boundary
               (i.e. should be given a boundary condition).
           FRACTURE: All faces that are split (i.e. has a connection to a
               lower dim grid).
           TIP: A boundary face that is not on the domain boundary, nor
               coupled to a lower domentional domain.
