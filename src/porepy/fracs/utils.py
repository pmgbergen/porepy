def snap_fracture_set_2d(pts, edges, snap_tol, termination_tol=1e-2, max_iter=100):
    """Snap vertexes of a set of fracture lines embedded in 2D, so that small
    distances between lines and vertexes are removed.

    This is intended as a utility function to preprocess a fracture network
    before meshing. The function may change both connectivity and orientation
    of individual fractures in the network. Specifically, fractures that
    almost form a T-intersection (or L), may be connected, while
    X-intersections with very short ends may be truncated to T-intersections.

    The modification snaps vertexes to the closest point on the adjacent line.
    This will in general change the orientation of the fracture with the
    snapped vertex. The alternative, to prolong the fracture along its existing
    orientation, may result in very long fractures for almost intersecting
    lines. Depending on how the fractures are ordered, the same point may
    need to be snapped to a segment several times in an iterative process.

    The algorithm is *not* deterministic, in the sense that if the ordering of
    the fractures is permuted, the snapped fracture network will be slightly
    different.

    Parameters:
        pts (np.array, 2 x n_pts): Array of start and endpoints for fractures.
        edges (np.ndarray, n x n_fracs): First row contains index of start
            of all fractures, referring to columns in pts. Second contains
            index of endpoints.
        snap_tol (double): Snapping tolerance. Distances below this will be
            snapped.
        termination_tol (double): Minimum point movement needed for the
            iterations to continue.
        max_iter (int, optional): Maximum number of iterations. Defaults to
            100.

    Returns:
        np.array (2 x n_pts): Copy of the point array, with modified point
            coordinates.
        boolean: True if the iterations converged within allowed number of
            iterations.
