    coarse_fine : sps.csc_matrix
        Column major sparse matrix mapping from coarse to fine cells.


    This method creates a mapping from fine to coarse cells by creating a matrix 'M' where the rows represent the fine
    cells while the columns represent the coarse cells. In practice this means that for an array 'p', of known values on
    a coarse grid, by applying the mapping
        q = M * p
    each value in a coarse cell will now be transferred to all the fine cells contained within the coarse cell.

    The procedure for creating this mapping relies on two main assumptions.
        1. Each fine cell is fully contained inside exactly one coarse cell.
        2. Each cell can be characterised as a simplex.
            - i.e. Every node except one defines every face of the object.

    The first assumption implies that the problem of assessing if a fine cell is contained within a coarse cell is
    reduced to assessing if the center of a fine cell is contained within the coarse cell. The second assumption implies
    that a cell in any dimension (1D, 2D, 3D) will be a convex object. This way, we can use existing algorithms in
    PorePy to find if a point is inside a polygon (2D) or polyhedron (3D). (The 1D case is trivial)

    The general algorithm is as follows (refer to start of for-loop in the code):
    1. Make a list of (pointers to) untested cell centers called 'test_cells_ptr'.
    2. Iterate through all coarse cells. Now, consider one of these:
        3. For all untested cell centers (defined by 'test_cells_ptr'), check if they are inside the coarse cell.
        4. Those that pass (is inside the coarse cell) add to the mapping, then remove those point from the list of
            untested cell centers.
    5. Assemble the mapping.
