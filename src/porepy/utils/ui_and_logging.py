    ``logging_redirect_tqdm`` provides functionality to make ``tqdm`` work together with
    loggers. It takes a list of ``logging.logger`` as inputs and adds additional
    handlers that work with ``tqdm``. However, currently (as of 12.05.2023) these
    handlers do not account for the logging level of the passed logger. This issue is
    known (see e.g., https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/1272) but not resolved yet.

    This function provides a workaround until the issue is fixed.
