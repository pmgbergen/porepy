"""A module containing mixins for defining fluid mixtures and relatd variables in a
PorePy model.

While the mixins operate on some base assumptions, they are highly customizable by
inheritance and the user is encouraged to read up on them.

Important:
    The framework does not support the variable switiching approach.

    Variables are persistent and the user must be familiar with the DOFs implemented
    in the class :class:`_MixtureDOFHandler` (whose methods are not supposed to be
    overwritten).

    Once the :meth:`~porepy.compositional.base.FluidMixture.reference_phase_index` and
    :meth:`~porepy.compositional.base.FluidMixture.reference_component_index` of a the
    fluid, :meth:`~porepy.compositional.base.Phase.reference_component_index` for each
    phase are set, the mixins create the mixture and associated variables and it is not
    possible to change fraction and saturation variables in the course of a simulation.

    """A class to help resolve the independent fractional variables of an arbitrary
    mixture, and respectivly the DOFs.

    .. rubric:: Assumptions and unity constraints

    1. Reference phase and component can be eliminated.

       - Phase fraction, saturation and component overall fractions of the reference
         instance can be expressed by unity of fractions.

    2. Components do not have to be in all phases. E.g., solid phase models usually
       contain only 1 mineral/component, or ions in liquid phase do not have to
       evaporate into a gas phase.
    3. Partial fractions of components in phases have to fulfill the unity constraint.
       A phase's reference component and its partial fraction are eliminated as DOFs.
    4. While the third point holds especially for partial (physical) fractions, it does
       not hold necessarily for extended fraction in the unified setting. Vanished
       phases with only 1 component still have extended fractions (weak unity).
    5. Tracer fractions of active tracers in compounds are always unknown (transport).

    .. rubric:: Resolution

    The logic of whether a fraction is an independent variable or not is implemented in
    various ``has_independent_*`` methods:

    1. Independent overall :attr:`~porepy.compositional.base.Component.fraction` of
       components and massic/molar :attr:`~porepy.compositional.base.Phase.fraction` of
       phases are determined by :meth:`has_independent_fraction`.
    2. Independent :attr:`~porepy.compositional.base.Phase.saturation` variables are
       determined by :meth:`has_independent_saturation`.
    3. Independent :attr:`~porepy.compositional.base.Compound.tracer_fraction_of` are
       determined by :meth:`has_independent_tracer_fraction`.
    4. Independent :attr:`~porepy.compositional.base.Phase.partial_fraction_of`
       are determined by :meth:`has_independent_partial_fraction` for all components
       and phases in the mixture, independent of whether an equilibrium is defined or
       not.
    5. Independent :attr:`~porepy.compositional.base.Phase.extended_fraction_of`
       are determined by :meth:`has_independent_extended_fraction` for all components
       and phases in the mixture, independent of whether an equilibrium is defined or
       not.

    Notes:
        The logic is guided by the

        - :meth:`~porepy.compositional.base.FluidMixture.num_components` in the
          :attr:`fluid_mixture`
        - :meth:`~porepy.compositional.base.FluidMixture.num_phases` in the
          :attr:`fluid_mixture`
        - :meth:`~porepy.compositional.base.FluidMixture.reference_component` and
          :meth:`~porepy.compositional.base.FluidMixture.reference_phase` in the
          :attr:`fluid_mixture`
        - :meth:`~porepy.compositional.base.Phase.reference_component` in each phase
          in the :attr:`fluid_mixture`

        It is also guided by the flags ``'eliminate_reference_component'`` and
        ``'eliminate_reference_phase'``, which can be set in the model's :attr:`params`.

        Finally, the ``'equilibrium_type'`` set in the model's :attr:`params` is used
        to determine the indepency of partial and extended fractions of components
        in phases.

    """Mixin class for models with mixtures which defines the respective fractional
    unknowns.

    Fractional variables are relevant for the equilibrium formulation, as well as
    for compositional flow.

    Various methods can be overwritten to introduce constitutive laws instead of
    unknowns.

    Important:
        For compositional flow without a local equilibrium formulation, the flow and
        transport formulation does not require phase fractions or extended
        fractions of components in phases.
        Phases have only saturations as phase related variables, and instead of extended
        fractions, the (physical) partial fractions are independent variables.

        When setting up models, keep in mind that you need to close the flow and
        transport model with local equations, eliminating saturations and partial
        fractions by some function depending on the primary flow and transport variables
        (pressure, temperature, overall fractions or pressure, enthalpy, and overall
        fractions).
