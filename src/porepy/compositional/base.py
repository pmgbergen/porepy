"""This module contains the base classes for elements of a mixture:

1. :class:`Component`:
   A phase-changing representation of a species involving some physical constants.
   Additionally, this class represents a variable quantity in the equilibrium
   problem. It can appear in multiple phases and has a fraction of the overall mass
   associated with it.

2. :class:`Compound`:
   A compound represents a combination of chemical species, which can be bundled into
   1 component-like instance. While one chemical species serves as the solvent,
   an arbitrary number of other species can be set as active tracers.
   Pseudo-components are not considered individually in the equilibrium problem, but the
   compound as a whole.
   But they are transportable quantities, with a fractional value relative to the
   overall fraction of the compound.

3. :class:`Phase`:
   An object representing a physical phase like gas-phase or a liquid-phase.
   A phase can contain multiple phase-changing components and the modeller must set
   those explicitly (see :attr:`Phase.components`).
   Components in a phase are characterized by their fraction of mass
   (:attr:`Phase.partial_fraction_of`), relative to the
   fraction of mass in a phase (:attr:`Phase.fraction`).

   The phase has also physical properties (like density and enthalpy) which come into
   play when formulating more complex equilibrium models coupled with flow & transport.

4. :class:`FluidMixture`:
    A basic representation of a mixture which is a collection of anticipated phases and
    present components, putting them into their contexts.

    Serves as a managing instance and provides functionalities to formulate flow &
    transport & flash equations using PorePy's AD framework.

Note:
    Phases are meant to be based on an Equation of State.
    A basic interface for such an equation of state is defined by :class:`AbstractEoS`.

Important:
    The physical units used here are in general SI units.
    For specific quantities, the framework can be used for both, molar and massic
    settings. Once chosen, it must be consistent throughout the set-up.

    Fractions are respectively molar or massic as well, though they are always
    dimensionless.

    A phase is identified by the (time-dependent) region/volume it occupies (saturation)

    Phases have physical properties, dependent on some thermodynamic input.

    - :attr:`specific_enthalpy`
    - :attr:`viscosity`
    - :attr:`thermal_conductivity`

    Components must be modelled explicitly in a phase, by setting :attr:`components`.
    (see also :class:`~porepy.compositional.compositional_mixins.

    Important:
        The components must be set in a phase, before adding the two contexts into

    - :attr:`fraction`
    - :attr:`saturation`
    - :attr:`extended_fraction_of`

    Both, properties and fractional unknowns, are only available once put into a

        Dependent on whether this phase is assigned as the reference phase or not,
        the operator representing the fraction or saturation might either be a genuine
        variable (:class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.operators.MixedDimensionalVariable`)
        or a dependent :class:`~porepy.numerics.ad.operators.Operator`,
        where the fraction and saturation were eliminated by unity respectively.

    Note:

        If the flow & transport model does not include an equilibrium formulation,

class FluidMixture:
    """Basic fluid mixture class managing modelled components and phases.

    The mixture class serves as a container for components and phases and contains the
    specification of the reference component and phase.

    It also allocates attributes for some thermodynamic properites of a mixture, which
    are required by the remaining framework, which are assigned by an instance of
    :class:`~porepy.compositional.compositional_mixins.FluidMixtureMixin`.

    - :attr:`density`
    - :attr:`specific_enthalpy`
    - :attr:`specific_volume` as the reciprocal of :attr:`density`

    The mixture allows only one gas-like phase, and it must be modelled with at least
    1 component and 1 phase.

    Flash algorithms are built around the mixture management utilities of this class.

    Important:
        Phases are re-ordered once passed as arguments according to the following rules:

        - If more than 1 phase, the first, non-gas-like phase is treated as the
          reference phase per default.
        - The single gas-like phase is always the last one.
        - The first component is set as reference component per default.

    Parameters:
        components: A list of components to be added to the mixture.
            These are the chemical species which can appear in multiple phases.
        phases: A list of phases to be modelled.

    Raises:

            - at most 1 gas phase must be modelled.
            - At least 1 component must be present.
