"""Storage classes for solid constants and fluid components.

Material contants are values representing either constant physical properties (e.g.
critical pressurre) or parameters for constitutive laws (e.g. constant compressibility
for exponential-type density law). A material is instantiated with a
:class:`~porepy.models.units.Units` object, which defines the units of the physical
properties for a simulation setup. While the constants must be given in base SI units
when instantiating a material class, its constants are converted and stored in the
target units, to be used subsequently.

For converting values on the fly, see :meth:`~porepy.models.units.Units.convert_units`.

class Constants:
    """Material property container and conversion class.

    The base class identifies a material using a given :attr:`name`. To define material
    properties of some kind, derive a dataclass with this class as its base (as
    keywords-only and ``eq==False`` data class).

    Constants are declared as fields (float or int) with default values.

    Derived classes must have a class attribute :attr:`SI_units` containing information
    about the the physical unit of each declared constant.

    If the user wants the material to be presented in other than SI units, a ``units=``
    kw-argument can be passed to declare the target, non-SI units (e.g. MPa instead of
    Pa).

    The base class provides a check that constants defined as dataclass fields
    are not asignable, once the instance is created. This is motivated by the fact that
    material parameters are not supposed to change (or converted to another unit) once
    given in a simulation.

    Note:
        When inheriting from this class and making another data class, use
        ``@dataclass(kw_only=True, eq=False)`` to be consistent with the base class
        and to make the child hashable (important when storing it in dictionaries).

        Having an overload of ``__equ__`` by comparing fields (as ``dataclass`` does)
        makes little sense for this class, as it is designed to hold different constants
        per instance. We loose only the hashability with the redundant ``__equ__``.

    Important:
        When instantiating a ``Constants`` data class, the constants must all be
        strictly given in SI units. The conversion happens post-initialization for the
        subsequent simulation.

    Important:
        Every derived class must have a class attribute :attr:`SI_units`, **annotated as
        ClassVar**. This is to inform the base class about the used SI units.

        For examples, see :class:`FluidComponent` or :class:`SolidConstants`. For
        instructions on how to write composed units, see
        :meth:`~porepy.models.units.Units.convert_units`.
