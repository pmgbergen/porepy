"""Module containing various data structures to store thermodynamic state values for
fluid mixtures.

Note:
    State data structures are required as a contract for which thermodynamic properties
    are required to describe a fluid in PorePy's flow & transport problems.

    The compositional framework does not rely purely on :mod:`porepy.numerics.ad`, but
    has multiple interfaces to obtaining values.

    1. Flash calculations: Must be fast, efficient and parallelized, hence no AD but
       generic interfaces and data structures.
    2. OBL: Operator-based linearizations introduces interpolated data into the
       framework. To safely and generically broadcast the data into the Jacobian and
       residual, these data structures are used.
