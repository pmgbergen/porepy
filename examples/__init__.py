"""Simulation examples for PorePy.

This module contains a number of examples of how to run a simulation using PorePy. Each
example contains functionality specific to the setup in question.

The simulation setups serve the following purposes:
    - Reuse in testing
    - Use in documentation
    - Use in run scripts and development
    - Promotion of specific test cases (e.g. benchmarks)

In the interest of manageable maintenance, the examples are actively curated and the
acceptance criteria for new examples are relatively strict.
