# Examples
This folder contains examples of PorePy from papers, presentations, code developments, etc.

# Example maintanence
We try to keep the up to date as the code evolves, but cannot always manage this.
Examples stored in files named test_something.py are part of the test suite, and are thus monitored regularly.
Examples that for one reason or another are not part of the test suite should still run; let us know if not.
Some examples may be outdated, but kept for historical or other reasons. These will be marked with an git commit id to a version of the code where the example works.

# Overview

* [papers](papers) contains the example from papers organized in sub-folders.
* [example1](example1) Examples from the benchmark study MBFPM-2017.
* [example2](example2) Convergence tests for Mpfa and Mpsa (both elastacitiy and poro-elasticity).
* [example3](example3) meshing of fractured domains. Cartesian, simple unstructured, and Soultz geothermal test site.
* [example4](example4) illustration of virtual element methods (mixed and hybridized). Also mixed-dimensional example.
* [example5](example5) Illustration of linear transport discretization. Both mono- and mixed-dimensional cases.
* [example6](example6) Coarsening of grids into polyhedral shapes.
* [example7](example7) Mixed-dimensional coupling with finite volume methods.
