# Examples
This folder contains paper examples of PorePy. The intention is that the results should be accessible and reproducable.

We try to keep the examples updated as the code changes, but may not always succeed due to lack of time, or simply because the code has changed so much that compatability is no longer prioritized. The papers should at least work with the commit that merged them into the main branch.
