    The method finds, for each fracture, how many of the nodes are end-nodes,
    how many of the end-nodes abut to other fractures, and also how many other
    fractures crosses the main one in the form of an X or T intersection,
    respectively.

    Note that the fracture sets are treated as if they contain a single
    family, independent of any family tags in set_x.edges[2].

    To consider only intersections between fractures in different sets (e.g.
    disregard all intersections between fractures in the same family), run
    this function first with two input sets, then separately with a single set
    and take the difference.

    Parameters:
        set_1 (FractureSet): First set of fractures. Will be treated as a
            single family, independent of whether there are different family
            tags in set_1.edges[2].

            as a single family, independent of whether there are different
            family tags in set_1.edges[2]. If not provided,
        tol (double, optional): Tolerance used in computations to find
            intersections between fractures. Defaults to 1e-4.

    Returns:
        dictionary with keywords i_nodes, y_nodes, x_nodes, arrests. For each
            fracture in the set:
                i_nodes gives the number of the end-nodes of the fracture which

                y_nodes gives the number of the end-nodes of the fracture which

                x_nodes gives the number of X-intersections along the fracture
                arrests gives the number of fractures that terminates as a
