"""Test for solution strategy part of models.

We test:
    - Restart: Here, exemplarily for a mixed-dimensional poromechanics model with
    time-varying boundary conditions.

    -Targeted rediscretization: Targeted rediscretization is a feature that allows
    rediscretization of a subset of discretizations defined in the
    nonlinear_discretization property. The list is accessed by
    :meth:`porepy.models.solution_strategy.SolutionStrategy.rediscretize`  called at the
    beginning of a nonlinear iteration.

    - Equation parsing: The tests here considers equations that are present in the
    global system to be solved, opposed to simpler relations (typically constitutive
    relations) that are used to construct these global equations. Tests discretization
    and assembly of the equations. TODO: Might become obsolete if full coverage is
    achieved for the test approach in test_single_phase_flow.py.
