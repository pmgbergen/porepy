"""Tests of the EquationSystem used in the Ad machinery.

The tests focus on various assembly methods:
    * tets_variable_creation: Test that variable creation from a EquationSystem works.
    * test_variable_tags: Tagging of variables, used for filtering in an EquationSystem.
    * test_get_set_methods: Get and set methods for variables.
    * test_projection_matrix: Projection from a global vector to one defined on a subset
        of variables.
    * test_parse_variable_like, test_parse_single_equation, test_parse_equations:
        Parsing of equations, and the methods used to do so. Thorough testing here means
        other tests can get away with fewer parameter checks.
    * test_secondary_variable_assembly: Test of assembly when secondary variables are
        present.
    * test_assemble_subsystem: Assemble blocks of the full set of equations.
    * test_extract_subsystem: Extract a new EquationSystem for a subset of equations.
    * test_schur_complement: Assemble a subsystem, using a Schur complement reduction.

To be tested:
    Get and set methods for variables

    The tests check that the expected variables and equations are present in

    Variables are only defined by strings; the alternative format of a variables is
    not considered, since the variables are only passed to EquationSystem.dofs_of()
    (via the method projection_to()) which is tested elsewhere.

    This test is run on a relatively limited set of equation-variable combinations

    parsing of variable and equation input is tested in separate tests, thus what
    remains is to test that given a set of equations and variables, the correct rows
