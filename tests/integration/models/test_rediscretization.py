"""This file contains testing that targeted rediscretization of models yields same
results as full discretization.

Targeted rediscretization is a feature that allows rediscretization of a subset of
discretizations defined in the nonlinear_discretization property. The list is accessed
by :meth:`porepy.models.solution_strategy.SolutionStrategy.rediscretize`  called at the
beginning of a nonlinear iteration.
