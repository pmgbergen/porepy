"""Tests for constitutive laws in the models.

The module contains a setup for testing composition and evaluation (in the Ad sense) of
constitutive laws for models. The setup is applied to the constitutive laws in the
models subpackage.

In addition to checking that evaluation is possible, the tests also check that the
compound classes contain the specified constitutive laws, thus revealing mistakes if
the classes are refactored.

    The workflow in the test is as follows: An object of the prescribed model is
    created, and the specified method is called. The three most likely reason a test may
    fail are:
        1. The method to be tested combines its components (grids, variables etc.) in a
           wrong way, causing an error in the call to the method.
        2. Something goes wrong in discretization.
        3. Something goes wroing in parsing of the Ad operator tree, perhaps due to
           combining matrices and arrays of incompatible dimensions.

    Parameters:
        model_type: Type of model to test. Currently supported are "mass_balance" and
            "momentum_balance". To add a new model, add a new class in setup_utils.py.
